      "299/10625 | DeckardHZ → This has to be the most beautifully boring game I have ever played I usually try to get through any game I play if it starts to bore me I ll just cut out the side quests and try to finish the main story But I honestly could not even be bothered with this game At first I enjoyed it I even grinded perfect pelts for the legendary satchel But then I realized why did I even do that There not really much point in expanding your inventory because all you can do is fill it with random food and trinkets you can just sell for money Money which doesn really serve much of a purpose aside from upgrading your camp But this game is just so tedious in EVERYTHING I had to tap out Every single story side mission needs at least a solid minutes of just slowly riding your horse next to whichever NPC is on that mission with you cooking and crafting have to be done for every single item individually and saving and reloading puts you in some random spot often nowhere near where you were when you saved Like there are upgrade systems for your horse your stats but it doesn really make much of a difference I think the problem is in a lot of other open world games there are things you can save up for like buying your own house or getting some high level gear etc In this there nothing like that In fact if you know about the end of the game it even MORE pointless to bother saving up money increasing stats etc I get that this is a story driven narrative game but the problem is IMO you can really mesh that with an open world format when you remove so much player autonomy If the game had JUST been a story driven game with limited ability to move around a small area and do a few side quests here and there I probably would have liked it more Now I haven tried the Online part GTA online ain exactly friendly towards new players and I don think rdr2 would be any different but it entirely possible a lot of my gripes are null and void in the online experience But as a single player experience I think rdr2 just fails GTA works because despite being a story driven experience there are still a lot of things you as a player can choose to do independently of the main quest In GTA when I get a bunch of money from a big heist I like hell yeah I can buy a new house get some new clothes weapons etc But in rdr2 it like oh ok more money I guess I can finish upgrading the camp or something It frankly confusing why Dutch keeps saying you need more money when you can literally just get meat and pelts for days for free\n",

      "460/10625 | rfandomization → One of the best games ever made Without hyperbole this was probably my second or third favorite first playthrough of all time MHGU kicks it off the top spot I like open world games that let you explore I like RPG mechanics and I like hunting As someone who never played RDR1 I went into this game essentially blind and it is an experience For me this game is a 10 10 but if you re a 100percenter there are definitely some frustrating elements that may turn off people from doing EVERYTHING like I did PROS Arthur Morgan is in the Pantheon of great video game protagonists He up there with Big Boss for me and that is saying something Shepard Geralt and Travis Touchdown are close seconds but man the journey you take with Arthur and it really is YOU taking it with the honor choices is pretty special He not a faceless self insert which makes the few decisions you do get to make matter that much more through the lens of his character He has some of the best character moments I ve ever seen in a game that dialogue on the train station bench and it not even all serious he funny as hell He broke the damn wheel I like hunting animals I have hundreds of hours in theHunter COTW RDR2 lets you hunt lots of animals The story is pretty good Most of the characters behave believably with a few strange exceptions and it easy to invest in the Van der Linde gang if you care It also insanely easy to not give a damn about them if you don want to engage but the story in a general sense can pull you in You can be cruel as hell to almost anyone you don like and it is cathartic to violate the Eighth Amendment on them Driscolls The world is rich and deep with so many odd things to find if you head off the beaten path What the heck is the witch circle in the north The homunculus creature in the boarded up house What going on with the Stranger in the sidequest that has you find rock carvings If you care about discovering things on your own the game provides ample opportunities to do that You can do almost anything you want as long as you re willing to suffer the consequences or reload the game I must have wiped out the Saint Denis police force or times with those numbers American Venom CONS Micah Horses Horse movement is finnicky and requires a bit of experience to get used to Wish I realized earlier that not spamming the run key when running through forests actually lets the horse autocorrect around trees My horses are all dumb as hell and I have fallen off a lot At least I learned the pet as you gallop to reduce stamina consumption early Killing horses reduces honor Killing dogs reduces honor Some of the things the characters do really make you wonder if the Van der Linde gang are just stupid How are you robbing the town you re camping next to while laying low guys Are you actually career criminals There a surprising amount of hair tearing story moments but that a bit nitpicky Oh man if you want to collect or farm anything without a guide you might be looking a while I only gave up and used one to finish off the orchid collection and dinosaur bones but there was lots and lots of fruitless wandering to find out where cougars and panthers spawned where Indian Tobacco was where to find gold rings it a chore if you re not immersed in it Hunting certain animals deserves its own point cause those little birds that you ll end up needing are annoying as to find and shoot Hunting big game is mostly fine even moose weren too bad for me but the little robin and oriole chicks My God Without the satchel to store 99 of everything you can store anything it feels like is not a high stack cap Getting that satchel can be damn frustrating if you don want to engage with the hunting mechanic so good luck with that Current outfit always taking up a slot in the horse and randomly erasing something you have stored when you pick up a hat is frustrating Unable to save every single hat you pick up I had to kill a sheriff every time I somehow lost my 10 gallon Stetson The menu wheel to select items took a lot of getting used to for me release to equip was weird at the start The snowy area that the game starts in is straight ass and was annoying to complete Most of the cons I ve listed are personal gripes with the game as opposed to poor design decisions I will note that the game is long even if you don complete everything and focus on the story and if you don care to chase animals large portions of the game will feel useless to you Other than that there isn much that I think is wrong with RDR2 Playing this game was one of the best video game experiences I ve ever had and I think it earned all the praise it gets and then some One of the few things I ve been recommened that I will say is not overrated\n",

      "2483/10625 | sludgebones → On its best days RDO is still a broken mess Queues for matchmade game modes take forever and rarely succeed in finding a lobby and when you do you re almost guaranteed to have some kind of cheater present The worst I ve seen is players invulnerable to all damage capable of making you explode if you aim at them or causing you to rack up bounties to exorbitant prices Best you ll get is someone with auto aim or some such which still makes it impossible to participate in a match let alone win Even while roaming around the overworld in Defensive more normally preventing unwanted PvP these players can still hit you with the Explode Constantly Until Forced to Exit the Game curse Sometimes they ll teleport you and the entire server population to the same singular point on the map Sometimes in a building never meant to be entered sometimes in the middle of the ocean Sometimes your horse will repeatedly despawn while riding it but to my knowledge this one is just a bug and not caused by cheating or modding Overall interacting with other players is highly discouraged as you never know what they re capable of and in what new and creative ways they can negatively affect your playing experience I tried playing with a friend for the first time and the process to even get in the same session as them was a long and miserable experience because there no Steam friends list integration it all has to be done through the Rockstar overlay which cannot be accessed on some controllers or keyboards if you have a 70 keyboard without the Home button nor can the hotkeys to bring it up be rebound to something more accessible You think the Rockstar Social Club option in the start menu would allow you to invite accept invites or otherwise message friends but to my knowledge it does none of that and in fact I still don know what it does The only workaround was to go to the web browser version of the Social club and send an EMAIL to add them to my Rockstar friends list Even if you receive a friend request notification or message you cannot click on it to view it or open the Rockstar overlay And even after successfully joining their session there was no indication which telegram missions were playable as a posse and which were solo only limiting the content that I had hoped we would be able to play together Also it crashes a lot Sometimes randomly and without any error message but also consistently whenever I tried to place a Wildfire Campsite Turning down the graphics settings mostly fixed the random CTD but the latter always brings up Unknown error FFFFFFFF A cursory search claims that this is also caused by cheaters in the lobby and does not occur in solo sessions but I can neither confirm nor deny myself Not recommended until some kind of anti cheat or server browser gets implemented but my expectations are not high Edit Installed a private server loader so now it playable\n",

      "2667/10625 | dangasa → Red dead redemption the crown jewel of Rockstar Games Set in the 19 20th century Wild West the game features conflicts between the state police and officials corporations indigenous people plantation houses and the gang Led by Dutch indignant outlaw bloodshed follows where there is money to be made or revenge to be sought after It is a redemption story for the main character to redeem some of the wrongs high honour play style committed on behalf of himself and the gang Unfortunately loyalty ends up at a high cost I generally had no negative experiences with the game except for three occasions in my 50 hours of Online play I encountered a modder two of which had malicious intentions At the beginning aiming for 100 completion felt like a grind after having done a story mode play through for 60 hours prior to my Steam purchase Right at he beginning when I installed the Rockstar launcher the previous achievements I had acquired you can buy the game directly from Rockstar Games buy a key appeared on my Steam account with a save game cloud save enabled from many years ago The game is divided into chapters and epilogue which provide over 100 missions on high honour run saving those who can be saved and doing optional missions The story missions can change the appearance or behaviour of open world elements and each of the gang members have some comments to make which adds to the vivacity of the camp life as well as the missions themselves All deaths are more or less tragic and surprise the player when they occur Being an outlaw has its risks The great aspects of the game Authenticity and historical accuracy in songs the setting taken after real world locations goods and services and much more It is not a simulator and in real life there is no slowdown mode you can juice up your horse when it dies etc Hunting and horse riding are two of the things which stuck out most though gunplay is entertaining to a point and are much more detailed and developed compared to Kingdom Come Deliverance or The Witcher and so many others of our favourite games In terms of performance the game runs on older hardware 1660Ti as well as new 4080 but you will likely require a beefy desktop computer to max out the graphics settings to play at 4k All the assets are well designed so it won look much worse on lower settings In my experience as long as you can maintain 50 60fps the settings will have lesser impact on the experience Lossless scaling might do the trick for some folks out there in this situation The not so great When the epilogue starts John is much different from when he was running with the gang He doesn just say whatever is on his mind and is trying to become someone other than who he has been This can be seen as conflicting to his character but ultimately he is no longer influenced by the gang and their decisions so he has to make choices for better or worse RDR1 shows how it all turns out when there is no more escaping the past The gameplay is mostly focused on the aspect of getting more money and shooting people in the face This can seem superficial for people who are more akin to liking traditional RPGs where you can choose how to approach a situation there is stealth option in some missions but that is not the point The Online mode is also about getting more and more money and gold but also introduces variety in roles such as collector bounty hunter trader etc and introduces a separate storyline taking place one year prior to the story mode which can draw some people in Not saying money is not necessary many games have it but the value of things you buy with it does not seem as high compared to what you could be doing with it buying and developing estates hiring workers etc like there are more legit ways to make money than Online mode leads us to and also more ways you could be spending it I played GTA Online for nearly 1000 hours and looking back can really say the money meant so much in the end compared to the fun in doing heists with other players the open world activities mastering different aspects of the game etc Tldr this game is worth every penny cent RDR2 Standard edition includes Online and Ultimate includes some additional content There is also Special edition I think one of them is worth it for the horse you get in story mode thoroughbred when you can yet afford anything decent You will also get 10 gold for activating two step authentication on your Social Club account via their website which I recommend doing to get your first role faster collector if you only intend to do all the achievements and want to level up quickly This might be the best story focused game I have ever played but more so RDR2 deserves all the credit it gets\n",

The attention of the detail is simply incredibly no matter whether I cross through dense lder ride ride or in a busy stand.And authentically, it just makes huge spa to explore the landscape and see what happens as a chest the ore around Arthur Morgan and the van der Linde gang is deeply and emotionally you are quickly in its struggle for berleben and their internal conflicts Arthur is a fascinating character whose development is being followed even if the controls are initially incorporated and the hunting is gripping and the huntingIs incredibly detailed There are so many things to do with missions about side activities like fishing or poker that it will never be boring. The game takes time to develop its story, but it is precisely this slowness to the incredible atmosphere and immersion with me this is not a swing but a characteristic that the game makes it so special is an incomparable experience even if I have already played for 45 hoursconvinces that this game is a masterpiece who is on a deep ore.\n",

      "3922/10625 | 76561199144690258 → Red Dead Redemption is more than just a video game it a journey an experience that sticks with you long after you ve put the controller down From the opening moments riding through the snowy mountains with the Van der Linde gang I was completely drawn into its world The level of detail is stunning every town every trail every sunset feels handcrafted and alive But beyond the beauty and realism it the story that truly hit me Arthur Morgan isn just another video game character he feels real Watching his growth seeing him struggle with loyalty identity and ultimately redemption was genuinely emotional I didn expect a Western game to make me feel so deeply but it absolutely did What makes RDR2 so special is the way it encourages you to slow down and take it all in It not just about shootouts and missions though those are great it about the little things Sitting around the campfire talking to your gang members watching the world go by on horseback it peaceful it thoughtful The game doesn rush you it lets you live in its world And because of that the emotional weight of the story hits even harder By the end I didn just finish a game I felt like I had lived through something powerful and unforgettable If you re someone who loves strong storytelling deep characters and a world that feels truly alive Red Dead Redemption is something you need to experience at least once\n",

      "4639/10625 | 76561198019686298 → RDR2 has been reviewed to death already but this game is simply a masterpiece The graphics effects still hold up in 2025 and are used as a benchmark for games made today The story dialogue voice acting is fantastic well written and deep Story game and ending makes you feel things Care for the characters Get invested and sucked into the story It one of those games that you play and look up realizing a few hours have passed Story points and interactions can be affected by your Reputation good bad Gameplay is a blend of stunning cinematics and open world freedom albeit the map opens up after completing several missions The intro could be straight out of a film it that good and this was in 2018 Although I ve seen speed runs of this game I strongly recommend against that It been deliberately designed to take it slow pay attention and explore There are random side missions artifacts herbs animals and hidden references sprinkled all throughout Furthermore you can hunt fish pick herbs and craft medicines coffee etc There is also a stamina health system and you ll need to keep an eye on that This may not be for all types of players the continuous character maintenance This also applies to your horse which can die You can have up to four horses and tame them in the wild too As far as replayability goes was complicated for me The story and ending really affected me and I had to put this down for almost a year I getting back into another playthrough but this isn the type of immediately replayable game such as GTA Borderlands Destiny etc these are all games I ve invested time into The game being a prequel to RDR1 and myself never playing the first game got me even more hooked Will pick up the first game soon Finally the game also has an online aspect Red Dead Online YMMV on this area The online is plagued with hackers cheaters and people that will blow you up from across the map kind of things There are ways to play in a private session but I feel Rockstar has let this game go a little and has done little to mitigate this Once you re past the cheaters though its fairly enjoyable side quests mini story missions and being able to possy up with friends in your own upgradeable camp and customizable character Wholeheartedly recommend this title for those that love lore deep rich story and get invested in games\n",

      "5106/10625 | bigmouth3834838 → Red Dead Redemption is nothing short of a gaming masterpiece From the moment you step into the boots of Arthur Morgan you re immersed in a world that feels alive in a way few games can replicate The attention to detail in every corner of this vast open world is astounding whether you re hunting in the mountains riding through bustling towns or simply watching the sunset the world feels rich and authentic The story is gripping and emotionally charged pulling you through Arthur journey with incredible depth and nuance Rockstar has created a narrative that isn just about action but about the weight of choices loyalty and the harsh realities of life in the late 1800s The character development especially that of Arthur is one of the best I ve seen in gaming Gameplay wise Red Dead shines with its seamless mechanics The controls can be a little slow at first but they re designed to be deliberate matching the pace of the world Whether you re engaging in intense shootouts riding your horse across vast plains or fishing by the river everything feels deliberate and rewarding The visuals are jaw dropping From the detailed landscapes to the realistic character animations every frame feels like a work of art And the soundtrack Perfectly complements the atmosphere whether it a quiet haunting tune on the guitar or an intense orchestral score during a gunfight If there one minor downside it the pacing at times particularly during slower story beats However it never detracts from the overall experience and it a small price to pay for the level of immersion the game provides In short Red Dead Redemption is more than just a game it an experience It the kind of game you can lose yourself in for hours exploring hunting and getting caught up in its beautifully tragic story If you re into open world games deep narratives or just love a good adventure this is a must play\n",

      "5257/10625 | HeyChelsea → Incredible game I give it a 10 Great story beautiful scenery everything is done superbly But I can say it perfect it does have some issues The biggest issue as others have pointed out is how slow everything is I get why they did it and it does fit the time period very well and I even like the slowness at times since it really makes you feel like you are out in the country of old America and provides a very chill gaming experience But man it can be a bit of a snooze fest at times Like I can really only play an hour or before I start getting zoned off on the horse The forced walking speed in the camps near objectives is also a minor gripe of that continuing slowness The other thing that isn great is the whole inventory system Swapping out guns is clunky and he always puts the guns back on the horse so then you have to get them off the horse again every time you want to engage Things like going into the general store and buying something you didn intend to because the camera shifted just slightly and now it pointing to another item Not being able to use the bed even though you are standing right in front of it but because the chest is a bit too close it will focus on the chest It nothing extreme but to have to deal with all of it in every play session begins to grind your gears a bit I wish all of those things were done a bit better but again it nothing too bad But what the game does well it does extremely well It definitely a casual story game so you ll be watching many cutscenes the difficulty is fairly easy but with plenty enough engagement in the action sequences The usual rockstar experience where you get so much money you don know what to do with it anymore is also present But the story will suck you in once you get past the hurdle that is the beginning chapter I wouldn play this sitting down in front of a PC but big picture mode with a controller is great and the visual fidelity is certainly up there to fit the PC standards especially on a 4K TV at 60fps I only paid 15 for it but honestly I even recommend it at 60 if you ve never played through it before and are wanting a story rich game to zone out to\n",

      "7394/10625 | EduardoPais → Intro Having never played the first installment I went into Red Dead Redemption with sky high expectations Both friends and countless online discussions had praised it as one of the best games ever made claiming it outshines even the latest AAA titles I can safely say it lived up to the hype While my time with RDR2 wasn flawless I can confidently state this game was ahead of its time The world feels alive brimming with detail and the characters and setting are so grounded complex and authentic that you can help but get invested It was a memorable ride albeit with a few bumps along the way RDR2 tells a story that takes its time You step into the boots of Arthur Morgan a member of the Van der Linde gang constantly on the run from the law The camaraderie within the gang feels genuine but so do the conflicts and tensions that gradually build Characters are nuanced layered and deeply human each with their own flaws and agendas That said the pacing is inconsistent Some quests rush through critical moments that deserved more time while others drag on when action or momentum would have served the narrative better This uneven rhythm was particularly noticeable in the first half of the game Thankfully the second half makes up for it twists and rising stakes kept me hooked and by the end the story delivers something truly powerful Arthur journey and the struggles he faces will stay with me for a long time The world is simply stunning I ve never seen the Old West so richly realized From snowy mountains to lush forests swamps dusty deserts and even a bustling city every environment is brimming with life Wildlife roams naturally towns bustle with activity and NPCs convincingly go about their daily lives Even in 2025 few open world games come close to the level of immersion RDR2 offers The interiors and level design are just as impressive Taverns hum with music laughter and gambling general stores are stocked with detail forests teem with predators and prey The sheer attention to detail in every corner of the game is staggering Here where things get tricky Technically nothing feels broken Gunplay is sharp and responsive horseback riding feels weighty and believable and even piloting the occasional vehicle works well The issue is repetition You ll spend a lot of time shooting and while the weapons are varied most of them handle similarly Beyond differences in recoil and accuracy rifles and revolvers don feel distinct enough I wish there were more combat mechanics things like suppressing fire richer melee combat or deeper stealth systems could have elevated the gameplay Horseback travel while immersive also becomes repetitive especially early on when money is tight and fast travel options are limited The interface and control scheme with its sheer complexity could use more intuitive design and better reminders for players Even in 2025 RDR2 looks breathtaking The draw distance is massive environments feel alive and the lighting especially at sunset or during storms is nothing short of spectacular Effects like rain mud and dirt add a layer of realism rarely seen in games Simply put it one of the best looking titles ever made Sound design is equally impressive Guns sound authentic tools and environmental effects feel satisfying and the world is sonically rich The only area that left me wanting was the soundtrack While the vocal tracks that accompany key story moments are fantastic they re too scarce I would have loved more traditional Western inspired background music to heighten duels rides or quiet campfire moments It there but not as prominent as I expected The performances however are flawless Every character from major figures to background NPCs feels believable and true to the setting Accents vary Southern Irish Mexican French and all are delivered with care and authenticity Arthur Morgan in particular stands out as one of gaming most compelling protagonists Red Dead Redemption is everything people say and more Its pacing stumbles and its gameplay can grow repetitive but those flaws are dwarfed by its strengths With a gripping and emotional story complex and unforgettable characters jaw dropping presentation and a world that feels truly alive RDR2 is an achievement in gaming It doesn just realize the Western fantasy it immerses you in it making you live it\n",

      "8707/10625 | brohemus1988 → Contains minor spoilers The story is really what sets this game apart It very well crafted a masterpiece from beginning to end and takes you on a rollercoaster that entices you to play through it several times Combat and story missions do feel a bit stale after a while when almost every mission ends up in a massive shootout but you can overcome that by doing other activities in between and not rush through the story missions The game entices you to take it easy and explore go hunting fishing and do stranger encounters for example Some of the game mechanics I not a fan of like the bounty and honor system which is a bit foolish at times but I can live with that because of the story ambience voice acting music and graphics environment The game can also feel a bit clunky at times with the animations and movement but it not a gamebreaking issue It took a while to get used to how slow the responsiveness feels especially if you are used to playing faster paced games but you will get used to it I also wish there were more uses for cash in the game so it doesn feel utterly pointless making it but the way Arthur story unfolds may actually be the exact reason cash has limited uses There are also some great mods available if you want to go that route Grab it on sale You won regret it Some of the best 20 bucks I have ever spent on a game\n",

      "9787/10625 | 76561198292458607 → A marvel of a game Never before have I played a game that felt so human and made me cry so easily Genuinely masterfully written Missions never feel old I can be catching a legendary fish on one and then suddenly conducting a train in another They never feel repetitive too the games never wastes your time Every second and scene feels like it matters like it was deliberately put there I only got burnt out from this game when travelling really It can get a bit annoying especially towards mid game and end game Some quests can be bugged too but never to the point of being impossible to do I usually had trouble with leading horses That being said even if I felt burnt out or was frustrated by some bugs here and there I always continued playing because of just how invested I was in the story and making sure everyone is happy If you re like me and try to role play the character you re playing this game will be perfect for you Arthur the protagonist has a journal where he writes about how he feels It gives genuinely wonderful insights into who Arthur is and what sort of situation he is in All the other characters always have really good insights into how they are too Dialogue that would seem like just filler give such important details into their personalities and values And the horses They feel like real animals They can have minds of their own at times either getting you into or out of trouble Either they masterfully evade trees during a chase or they suddenly start running sideways into God knows where I had an Ardennes while playing and I loved her to bits The models are really detailed too I could see the seperate muscles which I thought was insane And bonding with your horse feels really really meaningful I recommend this game 100000000 10\n",

Nature just sees nature from Lder Mountains Fl sse everything looks so realistic that you sometimes stop and only look at the landscape I also think that the game in the old west plays this whole old -fashioned way with horses small states and cowboys simply has a special charm you have a special charmReally in another time, the story also gripped me totally, it is not only exciting but also emotionally you really feverish with Arthur Morgan and all the decisions that you make the game more intensely. The characters are somehow their own head and its own story. The world makes the world totally alive and then the music that fits perfectly with the situations regardless of whether you ride through the landscape or in an exciting momentI like that you have so much freedom you can make missions exploring the world or simply pulling through the horse through the area. This make what you want to do what you want to do is really spa me is red dead redemption therefore a real masterpiece and a game that you should have experienced in any case in my opinion I find that it is definitely the cowboy and more realistic playing\n",
