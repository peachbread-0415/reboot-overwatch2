      "1170/18452 | Dapperly → I downloaded PUBG thinking I become a tactical battle royale mastermind Instead I ve become a professional bush camping simulator with the survival instincts of a lemming and the aim of someone trying to thread a needle during an earthquake I ve spent more time looting buildings than a post apocalyptic kleptomaniac and somehow I still can find decent armor when I need it This game operates on the principle that 100 people drop onto an island and 99 of them are better at literally everything than I am I ve been personally victimized by players who can headshot me while parachuting driving and probably while filing their taxes Meanwhile I empty entire magazines into enemies standing perfectly still and somehow miss every shot because apparently bullets have trust issues with my crosshair My early game strategy consists of land somewhere remote and loot peacefully which immediately transforms into land in the middle of a war zone because half the lobby had the same brilliant idea Every quiet location becomes a massacre site faster than I can say where did I put that helmet Hot drops aren a strategy they re elaborate suicide rituals for people with commitment issues The blue zone has become my nemesis personal trainer and life coach all rolled into one terrifying circle of inevitable doom I ve developed an unhealthy relationship with zone timing that borders on obsessive compulsive disorder Every rotation decision feels like advanced calculus performed under extreme duress while someone shoots at my kneecaps My vehicle driving skills peaked at functional disaster and have been declining ever since I ve flipped more cars than a demolition derby contestant having a breakdown and somehow I always manage to find the one rock on the entire map that can instantly destroy any vehicle My teammates refuse to let me drive which is probably wise but hurts my feelings Squad mode has taught me that communication is vital which is why my team and I have developed a complex language consisting entirely of panicked callouts like HE RIGHT THERE and BEHIND THE THING while pointing frantically at empty air We ve transcended traditional directional systems and now operate purely on shared confusion and mutual disappointment The loot RNG operates on advanced psychological warfare principles designed to test my sanity I can search 47 buildings and find nothing but crowbars and energy drinks while my enemies apparently spawn with fully kitted M4s and level everything The desire sensor is real and it personally offended by my equipment preferences My shooting mechanics have achieved a level of inconsistency that violates several laws of physics Sometimes I a headshot machine who can miss other times I can hit a building while standing inside it There no middle ground between accidentally good and aggressively terrible and I never know which version will show up to any given firefight The final circles are psychological torture chambers where my heart rate reaches levels that probably concern medical professionals I ve gone from confident top 10 player to sweating shaking mess who can remember which button reloads my weapon The chicken dinner is so close I can taste it but tasting it is as close as I usually get My inventory management has become more complex than actual military logistics I carry 400 rounds of ammunition I ll never use 15 healing items for situations that never arise and exactly zero of whatever I actually need when the shooting starts I a post apocalyptic hoarder with organizational skills that would horrify Marie Kondo The community ranges from helpful teammates who carry my incompetent corpse to victory to people who blame lag for every death despite having 12ms ping and fiber internet I ve been both the carry and the carried but mostly I the guy who gets knocked first and spends the rest of the match providing moral support from spectator mode Red zone bombardments are the game way of adding random death to an already stressful experience because apparently regular human opponents weren challenging enough Nothing says tactical gameplay like RNG artillery strikes that ignore all skill and strategy I ve been killed by more red zones than actual players which says something concerning about my positioning The weapon attachments system lets me build the perfect killing machine then immediately lose it to the first person who shoots at me because I forgot to actually use the weapon I spent 20 minutes optimizing My perfectly configured SCAR becomes someone else victory screenshot while I respawn and question my life choices 10 10 would voluntarily subject myself to elaborate psychological torture disguised as competitive gaming again PUBG has taught me that the real chicken dinner was the friends we disappointed along the way through consistently poor decision making and aim that defies mathematical probability Now excuse me I need to drop Pochinki for the 847th time while convincing myself this time will be different\n",

With a mandatory tutorial dragged completely in tilde a true waste of time unfortunately the experience worsens from the grotesque grotesque textures badly made visual visuals outdated seem to have the direct of a two -record game compensates the hard controls to move the clumsy character to the point of causing the overall product of a free game. Sad to see that a game that had a chance to be relevant today serves as a joke literally seems to run only on Xuxa's PC in the end of the accounts, or download a missed opportunity in the deserved forgetfulness\n",

      "12846/18452 | whyshoulditellyou → Great game if you re willing to put up with sucking for a bit while you learn the ropes and finding any driver issues that might cause crashing I have been playing since beta took a multi year break for a while in the middle there but the gameplay loop hasn changed much some QoL stuff that been added improved over the years but still as satisfying and adrenaline infused as the early days They have however added what feels like 15 different types of random microtransaction currencies stores within the game and a god awful GUI which one can basically just ignore unless you feel the need to look a bit goofy cool whatever I am still part of the buy nothing club aside from the game itself before it became F2P and don plan to spend any more money in these various shops menus Bugs still exist but generally it seems to have to do with drivers not being up to date or very outdated hardware On my home PC which is a few years old as of 2025 I don experience crashes ever A friend was having lots of crashing issues lagging and subsequently did not enjoy playing the game at all However once the problems were fixed largely drivers a much needed reformat Nvidia app settings etc they have become the biggest PUBG fan I currently know haha Not sure exactly when but the game has been experiencing a sort of resurgence and wait times for most kinds of matches FPP at least as that all I play are very low\n",

      "14431/18452 | 76561199216097787 → I just wanted to share my extremely frustrating experience with the recent PUBG aespa collaboration event I completed the entire Step Up path spending well over 8000 COIN plus extra on additional crates using both real money and BP nearly 40 BP crates I also used almost 1500 AESPA tokens on emotes weapon skins and that scam lootbox The worst part is that despite all of that I never received a single outfit skin Not from Step Up Not from Prime Crates Not from any of the bonus drops Meanwhile I seeing other players post screenshots of getting full skins from Step or Step while I spent everything and ended up with a couple of sprays one literally being just a dupe of Giselle On top of that I made the mistake of using my AESPA tokens too early thinking I wouldn spend more money on the event I genuinely believed I wouldn invest further so I spent 600 tokens on Emote Set 500 on a weapon skin 200 for another lootbox worst idea and 150 for pan skin Only later did I realize that if I had just waited and saved up 1500 tokens I could ve gotten one of the main skins directly That my fault and I take responsibility for it but the system is built to confuse and pressure players like me into making rushed decisions There no pity system No guaranteed drops No protection for players who actually complete the full event path No transparency when spending tokens It honestly feels predatory and it left a really bad taste I don mind spending money to support PUBG or an artist I love I a Karina fan but this made me feel scammed Like I wasted money time and excitement If these AESPA skins ever return in the future I not spending another cent unless something seriously changes PUBG needs to Add a pity system or drop threshold Offer proper token guidance or warnings This could ve been an amazing event Instead it the most frustrating experience I ve had in PUBG so far I started playing only for Aespa\n",

      "16839/18452 | rivenwhim → It difficult to recommend this game REGARDING QUALITY The game has been in a terrible state for years and even after raking in truckloads of cash from players the game didn get better Today the game has evolved quite a lot but meh it still feels a little sloppy sometimes Overall it looks good I suppose REGARDING DEVELOPER PUBLISHER ATTITUDE Micro transactions are absolutely predatory Everything is absurdly priced and of course random to make sure you need to spend as much as possible So you want a camo jacket and would be willing to pay for it Nah start opening loot boxes and once you ve spent 100 you MIGHT be able to put together something camo like Obviously battle pass and other predatory FOMO tactics I will not get into right now Oh by the way if right now you re thinking bUt tHe gAmE iS FrEe or bUt it jUsT cOSmEtIc or BuT i dOn bUY tHeM I have bad news for you you are vulnerable to these tactics and you are being exploited Sorry REGARDING CHEATERS I have read different people say the game currently contains 25 cheaters I am not sure where they got this info but I didn see such thing in my games I might have seen one or two Maybe they only show up at higher ranks But if so many people agree I suppose there must be some truth to it Oh at higher ranks players will move erratically to avoid enemy fire Maybe it doesn bother you To me this is cheating It a realistic shooter game and having players bending alternatively sideways shouldn be allowed I can believe we still don have stamina bars in shooters in 2025 REGARDING DIFFICULTY There is no learning curve The game is pretty dead which means no new players join and the average players are gone There are only pros left which means anyone trying to learn the game will be matched against pro players who will delete you without you being able to react or understand what happened Time to kill is almost zero Considering loading times lobbies and looting phase you have no chance of learning anything in a gunfight ever There are bots especially in casual games mode but you learn nothing from killing them because they can shoot straight and have no strategy Most die in the zone OVERALL If you can forgive the predatory store you are willing to learn the hard way and you don care too much about the cheaters there is much potential to PUBG This game is not about pointing and shooting altough it helps it about planning reacting moving positioning By planning carefully and being tactical you can outsmart your opponents and that is how you win at this game and it is very satisfactory to do so I would say it is worth trying but remember it going to be tough so be patient Add me to friends if you like to play together some time\n",

What I am at PUBG, particularly beautiful, the further development. There are always new updates with exciting content, be it new weapons vehicles or events The community is huge and it makes you part of this global community of players looking for oneDemanding and rewarding gaming experience must simply try out the absolute recommendation from me\n",
