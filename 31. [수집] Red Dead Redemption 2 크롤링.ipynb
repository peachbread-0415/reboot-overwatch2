      "\n",
      "Edit: Because the white knights of Bungie, defenders from legitimate criticism have arrived, I'll make myself even more clear:\n",
      "THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE CONTENT I HAVE PAID REAL WORLD MONEY FOR NO LONGER EXISTS IN THE GAME. THIS IS INEXCUSABLE, AND HAD ANY OTHER COMPANY DONE THIS WITHOUT A PRE-ESTABLISHED BASE OF ADDICTED PLAYERS WHO HAVE SUNK COSTED THEMSELVES INTO IGNORING EVERY SINGLE PROBLEM THE GAME HAS, THAT COMPANY WOULD BE BANKRUPT WITHIN A MONTH\n",
      "\n",
      "If the literal worst possible business practice a gaming company could commit to its users is somehow still not enough for you, here's a short list of some other grievances I have with the game:\n",
      "\n",
      "Terrible, slapped together last minute story telling that sees character arcs introduced, barely developed, and then suddenly concluded, such as Crow and Amanda Holiday apparently having a romantic thing going on until oops she's dead now (no I don't mind spoiling this you can't even play that content anymore why do you care) all so that Crow can be big sad in The Final Shape. It's clear that a lot of the story telling in modern Destiny 2 is just checking off boxes and moving on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recycled content, and no I don't mean \"Oh how dare they bring back an old strike from D1\" I mean tossing old content into a blender and slapping a shader and a $40 price tag on it and calling it a day. The newest subclass, chromatic, was marketed with the same flair and fancy of a fully fledged subclass, but is in fact just a mash-up of other subclasses. Seasonal content has been repeatedly criticized for just being the same basic activities over and over again, and just in general the gameplay loop is just that, a loop. After a while you're not playing to see what new things get added, you're just going through the motions while you wait to be dripfed new narrative content.\n",
      "\n",
      "And lastly, the financial element and content model make this game impossible to recommend to people, which is a shame because the game is really only fun with friends. The on-boarding is just kinda terrible. No one wants to play a game that they're gonna have to pay $100/year for and dedicate large amounts of their time to just to stay up to date with what's happening in the story. The main reason I quit in the end was simply because I had a job and a life to live and friends I wanted to spend time with. This game demands so much of your money and attention, and unless you and several of your friends are willing to suffer through that, it's just not worth it. And if you think you'll make friends in the community, trust me, statistically you wont. Destiny, despite being an MMO, was a shockingly lonely experience for me. The playerbase largely cares exclusively about performance, and those who don't have long since been scared into not engaging with other players because the environment is just toxic.\n",
      "\n",
      "If this is not enough to convince you to avoid this game, you seriously need to raise your standards. There are better games out there, trust me.\n",
      "2/2500 | 76561198960596025 → Now I can still hold back the slutty operation of the chicken and pre-order the 8th year of the year. I would like to call it the shit-eating king\n",

      "\n",
      "As a reward for picking up this game in 2025, you will be granted with barren scraps of content due to Bungie removing the fully realized singleplayer campaign. Instead you get a checklist of unrelated missions haphazardly strung together which will do nothing to prepare you for the inner workings of the game, and certainly won't tell you anything you need to know about the state of things in the story.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suppose you set aside everything so far and decide to play the game in earnest in spite of it all. Congratulations, to unlock anything more than aimless wandering and the odd strike or other core gamemode, you can spend hundreds of dollars to buy the still available expansions.\n",

Of course, you can't actually purchase the first 80% of the game due to the now infamous strategy of Bungie's called \"vaulting\" (read: erasing) which deleted existing expansions and the entire base Destiny 2 (all of which was full-price paid content). Now to understand the story you get about zero information except a few paragraphs in the corner of your map which are expected to cover approximately eight years of continuous updates across two games.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not only does Bungie have a proven track record of deleting expansions without warning, but they can do just fine with conveying it upfront too. For years now, the main engine of this game has been Seasonal Content; a severely FOMO-driven strategy which multiple times a year sells to you: (again for the price of an entire game)\n",

The various planets, dimensions, pocket realities and so on each have their own striking scenery to well and truly rival even the greatest landmarks here on Earth. Not to mention everything from the symbology, weaponry, even GUI share a similar brilliance. And of course there is the very fundamentals of the story, a story of Light and Darkness. A story of how Destiny does not surrender to the cliche and predictable nature of such forces as Light and Darkness.\n",

Many longtime fans to this day put up with outright abusive actions from Bungie management just to hang on to the aftertaste of what Destiny had to offer. Which is why I have to recommend against beginning this game as it is now. Truly, the worst case scenario is that you fall in love with this game as so many before. And end up sticking through so much more hardship than you honestly deserve.\n",

They intentionally release something incredibly strong to boost sales of an expansion on to nerf it into oblivion/unusability shortly after release or shortly before the next expansion to again drive sales of the latest thing. They release mechanics like crafting to help solve vault/item space limitations as well as to serve as a definitive form of bad-luck-protection for the low RNG mechanics in the game that have been broken several times, proven by the weight-gate scandal that recently occurred, and still seems to be occurring.

      "\n",
      "I started in the Red War.I had not known the first destiny, so everything was new.And frankly?It was solid.A real atmosphere, a controlled gameplay, a neat artistic direction.Bungie really seemed to hold something.\n",
      "\n",
      "I went through a lot of seasons, sometimes with breaks, but not by weariness or lack of fun.I also liked solo game, and despite her faults, Destiny offered a unique experience.When I was in it, I was fully.When I was taking a break, it was just to blow or test something else.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then arrived The Witch Queen.There, hat.A well punctuated campaign, a scenario finally up to the task, the overhaul of 3.0 doctrines, a real build system, advanced personalization ... In short, it was the post-launching golden age.Bungie gave the impression of having understood his community.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Lightfall did everything in the air.A flat, wobbly, badly constructed campaign.Secondary characters thrown there as a decor, a blurred scenario, and above all a redesign of the mods and builds that emptied the game with all its depth.The gameplay was still there, but the interest quickly evaporated.\n",
      "\n",
      "And it was at this precise moment that marketing took over.The real gameplay was no longer in the game, he was in the lives: hollow promises, empty sentences, forced smiles.The summit of ridicule?This Twab, during the Lightfall year, where Bungie proudly announced that we could finally ... put shaders in favorite.So.In a ruined year, with free fall content, we sell you as a major \"feature\".That's the reality: Bungie speaks as if he revolutionized the game, when he just repainted the walls of a building that takes water.\n",
      "\n",
      "Final Shape has straightened the bar a little.Correct campaign, good conclusion.But hard to forget the sinking of the previous year.And when you add to that the absence of a French version for the last season, the lack of consideration becomes obvious.\n",

      "Then comes Echoes.Armor 3.0, well -oiled livestreams, beautiful visuals, beautiful words.But in the background?Nothing reassuring.We sell you transformations into a ball as if it were a major turning point in the gameplay.Except that we are still talking about a looter-shooter.No platform game.And in the end, you just feel like you are witnessing a new marketing stroke, not a real evolution in the game.\n",
      "\n",

      "So no, I'm not just break.I am lucid.Destiny 2, it has become hollow.And as long as Bungie continues to prioritize his image on the real content, it will be without me.\n",

      "36/2500 | 76561198060070611 → I've been following the information for a while since I stopped, but the development Bungie's constitution remains the same, and it's not a work that I can recommend to people who are starting this game now.*Please read this as if the gameplay itself is basically not bad.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reason is, first of all, I don't understand the story at all!!\n",
      "If you've bought this game, bought all the DLC, bought the Season Pass, and now you can finally follow the entire story, you're wrong.First of all, the quest story called Red War, which is the basis of this game, has been removed from the game.Also, the season's story, quests and all the activities of that season between DLCs are all in one place, except for the ones added in the latest DLC.And of course, it doesn't include Destiny 1 content.\n",
      "So when I start a new one, who is this?People like that have talked about various tutorials, and when that's over, who is this?People like that would come to me as if they had already played the game, and I thought, but who was this?People like this are said to be a dangerous person and it's not okay to defeat them, and if someone returns to social spaces, who is this?As someone like this dies and the tutorial ends, a bouquet of flowers is being handed to the place where the person was, and who is this?Something like this will last forever.What is this?\n",
      "I started in season 14, but I didn't know.It was so hard to understand that this game didn't have a story, so I kept shooting and killing someone with a physical gauge.There is a human heart.\n",
      "←←←← There are rumors that it will disappear in the next DLC (Edge of Fate).\n",
      "It's impossible for people who play games for a few hours and then quit quests halfway through, and there's no way they can know if it's okay to do that.\n",
      "So, then, how do you follow the stories so far?When asked, this was really bad, and according to developer Bungie, you should look at the outline of the story of Flappera, which could fit into a single sheet of A4 paper in the game, or from the Destiny channel on YouTube!That's what it is.Say it in the game.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, I don't know what to do!!\n",
      "I really had no idea.In fact, I started playing this game with two rear friends, but I had both dropped out and managed to keep on going, so I somehow understood what I was going to do, so I explained it, and then finally the three of us were able to start this game together.\n",
      "Anyone who's played Borderlands or something like that will understand, but this game (on the surface) calls itself a router shooter.So if you can do it, you'll just have to do seasonal activities and dungeons, or raids if you have friends, and dig into good park weapons or armor with good stats.However, since the story is not understood above, and the fact that it is left unresolved without either the right or left is not clear, I don't think I'll be motivated at all unless there's someone who will play with me, or someone who has already played it and who will not be ignorant of beginners and will teach you about this game in a polite and polite way.\n",
      "By the way, I had thrown away the story and kept increasing the power value.In the end, that was the correct answer, so the specifications probably haven't changed yet, so if you've just started, just find out whether you're a weapon with high power values or armor and throw away everything else in the warehouse or throw it all away.Are you okay.Most weapons are just difficult to use due to the composition of the perks, so dig into the weapons you use once you have increased your power values.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Third, the development ego is too strong!!\n",
      "It's quite strong.No, it's a bit weird when you ask me what it's like to run a normal game, but no matter how long the bugs go, the buff nerfs are repeated that have no meaning to do it, the PVE and PVP are not adjusted separately, the PVE and PVP are posted on Reddit just by asking each or two requests, etc., making it seem as if players are just customers who have just bought the product.\n",
      "I was so sad about this point that I ended up quitting Destiny because I was tired of chasing the game.Well, why did I do that every time I read Bungie's blog (This Week In Bungie/Destiny) and the occasional patch notes?I was so frustrated that I was just piling up.\n",
      "Well, for example, let's say that the weapon A was strong with an ability called B.In such cases, Bungie simply does not nerf the weapon called A.In addition, the ability B has been significantly altered and no longer used, and nerfs have also been derived from other weapons with the same nature, and in the end, the situation where weapon A is strong remains, and the balancing process is often performed, where the synergy between weapons and abilities becomes relatively weak, making the game less interesting.\n",
      "No, this might be better.What's even worse is that adjustments in PVP somehow affect PVE as well.This game is surprisingly focused on interpersonal battles, and I would like people who are good at such things to play, but for PVE players who aren't like this, this is just a problem.Anyway, you'll be pulled by the PVP and nerfed your weapons and abilities!In fact, PVP adjustments can even be interrupted by the PVP adjustments, even though they were too strong in PVP, even armor that could no longer be equipped for six months throughout the game.I was really disappointed.As someone who seriously builds up something like this, I feel more pissed than I'm in a position to bear my head, and I feel like I'm being swayed by development, which is just painful to see how I have to change the build according to those adjustments.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, I don't recommend this game unless you can ignore the above three, especially beginners, and if you have someone to join in with or a veteran player like Buddha, next to you.The more people who come with me for the first time, the more interesting it becomes.No, there are other things like the fact that Destiny-related news is not displayed in the game, some events held every three months are boring, and all the new weapons added simply changed the skins of existing weapons, but for now I'd like to finish my review with the above three points that caught my eye the most.Thank you to everyone who played the game with me so far.It was fun.\n",

In addition to the lack of dayone records, it was more perfect. I passed the speed-passing, and I had no time to beat it. I had the title. The Iron Lord started to brush it in the late n6 period and it was also gold-plated four times. It was all over.\n",

My save is lost and the technology is still there. I can fight back in two or three days. I can't stand it if you let me eat another two thousand hours. I can't stand it anymore. I have been using equipment for so long to make it cool in a warm water environment. Now I don't have fun.

      "\n",
      "Edge of Fate is, without question, the worst campaign Bungie has ever released—and I’m someone who actually finished Lightfall. This one? I just can’t. I’ve tried. And then MetaSpark shows up. Again. And again. And again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s talk about MetaSpark. Who at Bungie sat in a meeting, listened to the idea of “turn into a glowing orb and fly through holes,” and actually gave it a green ligt? I’m sorry, but that one over there needs to get laid. Because this whole mechanic? It screams unresolved urges. Seriously? Nobody picked up on that? You become a glowy space tadpole. Then you search for an opening to thrust into it. Over. And over. It's not clever. It's not deep. It’s not fun. It’s awkward, bizarre, and on top of that, completely kills the flow of what could’ve been an otherwise halfway decent mission. There’s nothing immersive about morphing into a glittery tadpole and playing a \"puzzle\" of find the hole.\n",
      "\n",
      "And just to rub it in, every boss fight in the campaign follows the exact same pattern: three health bars. Damage one, then do a spark \"puzzle\". Repeat. Again. It’s formulaic. Lazy. I genuinely felt insulted as a longtime player. There’s no tension, no payoff—just button presses and...penetrating holes.\n",

      "Lordi? Great voice acting. Shame he looks like he belongs in a Pixar side story about space dads.\n",
      "Ikora? I can't listen to her all-knowing, self-righteous tone anymore. I don’t even care about the voice change. I just don’t want to hear her deliver another smug monologue about how we should \"trust the plan\" while I’m doing my 15th spark-float \"puzzle\" in a row.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve been playing Destiny since Day One on PlayStation. I remember when boss fights actually made my palms sweat. When a campaign mission pulled me in and made me feel something. Now? It’s just spark tubes, button presses, and NPCs PRETENDING like it’s all meaningful.\n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR:\n",
      "Unless Bungie removes 80% of the MetaSpark, I won't touch this garbage again. Don’t waste your time. Don’t waste your money. Destiny used to be something special for me. Edge of Fate is a very sad farewell to a game I used to love.\n",
      "69/2500 | jmythereal2000 → this game is genuinely not worth playing as a new player right now\n",
      "the new gear systems only apply to new gear, meaning getting any gear from the 26 seasons of content before edge of fate is practically worthless\n",
      "legacy exotics can't be masterworked, legacy legendarys don't have tiers and legacy armor do not have archetypes, meaning playing previous campaigns on the 7 or 8 planets, doing any activity's like eternity, vanguard ops, gambit, nightfalls are a waste of time\n",

      "There are good changes and moments that only delight, but there are also extremely uncomfortable changes in the general details that began to only push off their appearance and possibly not only me.I have seen a lot, but it forced me to delete the game that I played with pleasure and loved to spend time in it.\n",
      "Given the current statistics on the online and interest in the DLS at the exit .... or Banji turned the wrong way, which clearly shows the absolutely idiotic change in the screen of the destination and a completely “beautiful” gray palette on this screen (it looks like a spit in the direction of the old community), or there is nothing more to offer, although they are also to offer them.\n",
      "If the bung continues in the same spirit and will also feed us with content with holes teaspoons, then I cannot recommend the game.\n",
      "71/2500 | 76561198154731462 → After more than 2000 hours of game, I have to say: I can no longer recommend this game with a clear conscience.\n",
      "The reasons for this are:\n",
      "- The focus on a strictly curated gaming experience\n",
      "- the prerequisite of the new addon and optional of the Season Pass (which is now called Reward Pass).\n",
      "- The more than sad selection among the dealers and vendors\n",
      "- Open activity is veiled because access only seems to be preferred by the portal\n",
      "- Activity choice such as PvP or Gambit no longer have a pathway that gave these activities a nice variability.\n",
      "\n",
      "In my eyes, bungie is only interested in presenting the player to present the content that they think is correct and want to determine the freedom of choice.One of the very big and coherent features was that the player could develop in every direction that he liked.Now everything was shortened on a very narrow path.\n",
      "In addition, the game world does not feel as if it were still important and I also have no more access to already purchased game content.When the latter has been fixed, I may look back in.\n",
      "72/2500 | ldskz → Make no mistake, the game is very good and has a lot of content.The company that makes the game has its flaws, but the truth is that they all have, the difference is that this we end up knowing.\n",

      "The experience for new players is pitiful, the game is too complex in the current state and rewards more knowledge than skill.If you want to start playing, look for a newbie clan or look for friends who already play on social networks, chats or reddit platforms.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, don't care if anyone says they didn't like it, it's fashionable to talk badly about Bungie and Destiny, what I recommend is that you make your own experience and draw your own conclusions.\n",

With the most recent release of Edge of Fate Bungie has released the most boring mission heavy DLC ever so far. If you want to roll around in a ball repeatedly doing the same mechanics over and over again this is the game for you.

Also, a lot of content I paid for was taken away, and the developers are known to do this frequently. Despite some strong co-op experiences one can have with Destiny 2, I'll stick with Warframe and devs who actually seem to care.\n",

      "\n",
      "The game, in which I invested a lot of money and time, is felt empty today: a significant part of the content I bought simply disappeared.Imagine you pay additions, wait for history, locations, activity - and after a while they are erased from the game.This decision of Bungie still remains unacceptable to me and, frankly, undermines trust.\n",
      "\n",
      "Plot\n",
      "Unfortunately, problems are not limited to this.The plot is served fragmentarily: the characters appear, almost do not get development and immediately leave the scene.An example is the story of Crowe and Amanda Holide, who ended with a sudden tragedy ,.\n",
      "\n",
      "Content increasingly looks like processing old ideas.The new “chromatic” subclass was presented as, but in reality it is rather a mixture of existing mechanics.Seasonal activity is repeated, and the game cycle turns into routine: instead of expecting novelty, there is a feeling.\n",
      "\n",
      "The financial side is a separate pain.To stay in the subject, the player must spend more and regularly return, otherwise he loses the thread of the plot.For beginners, the entrance threshold is high: the training is confusing, and it’s hard to get used to friends.Alone, Destiny 2 quickly becomes disappointingly empty and even toxic due to the requirements of the community.\n",

      "\n",
      "Destiny 2 is a game with huge potential, which is drowning in controversial solutions and an outdated monetization model.If you have a company of friends and willingness to put up with Bungie business policy, you can find pleasure here.But if you are looking for an honest, whole adventure with long -term value, it is better to look at other projects.\n",
      "93/2500 | 76561198133644122 → A good game, it is a pity that then we will be taken away by motivating it with the fact that online it was small or something like that, but in fact they will release the third part and the second will close that people go to play the third\n",

      "Pros:\n",
      "The game is fun and has plenty of content available (campaigns, PVE and PVP missions, dungeons and raids).\n",

      "Live Service real (constant updates and many years of support).\n",
      "\n",
      "Cons:\n",
      "Bad movement (especially in the Warlock class).As a Warframe player, this was very striking.\n",
      "The monetization model is very scrupulous (you pay for new expansions from time to time, but Battle passes are not included - only if you buy the annual pass, which is more expensive. In addition, some expansions do not come with your dungeons included, being necessary to buy keys for these dungeons separately, to +/- 100 reais each.which is absurd for a game that already charges you even for breathing inside it.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Conclusion:\n",
      "I recommend Destiny 2 for those who like bullet and grind.After all, you can do some things F2P and enjoy well if you have taken the Legacy Pack on the promotion for 24 Pila.Otherwise, I only recommend it to those who have no problem putting 200-300 tale in a time in time.\n",
      "95/2500 | 76561199019470346 → A drug that makes you dependent, both for better or for worse.As long as the story is playing or PVE remains one of the best games ever existed, once introduced to the PVP you wonder why you have installed the game and start looking at the hammer you keep in the desk drawer and ask yourself why you are not using it to hammer the temples or testicles.And despite these thoughts, you will continue to play it because in the end you have no friends, and this is a form of entertainment that makes you dependent.I recommend it to all masochists and to those who have no friends.(Free to play in this game is comparable to a vegan salad with curry chicken inside)\n",

All the original writers and creative leaders are gone or have been laid off so that Pete Parsons can buy more super cars. If you do the slightest amount of research you can see that Joseph staten was one of the main Book/lore writers at Bungie. Once he left plenty of the other main developers and creators followed or were fired. The games main story was scrapped and thrown into a bucket of ideas, designed to be sold as peices of content for years. Without a solid creative/ productive team left at Bungie each one of the DLC was just worse/lazier than the last, and more micro transactions, fomo, content vaulting, and sunsetting continued to bash players for investing their time.\n",

      "-------------------------------\n",
      "(original review follows)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Perspective from a Filthy Casual Noob:\n",
      "\n",
      "Destiny 2 remains, in my opinion, the pinnacle of looter-shooters. No other game comes close to its gunplay and overall feel. Is Bungie a money-hungry corporation? Sure, but who isn’t in this industry? Do you absolutely need all the DLCs and add-ons? No, but they certainly enhance the experience, and they’re often bundled at a discount.\n",
      "\n",
      "That said, the game could really use a better onboarding experience for newcomers. Destiny 2 does a poor job of introducing new players to its systems, though Bungie has promised significant improvements in the upcoming season. While there’s some guidance for the basics, many aspects of the game are left for you to discover randomly or with help from your clan (which makes sense since it’s a social game after all, and MMOs rarely teach you everything).\n",
      "\n",
      "If you’re willing to navigate these rough edges, you’ll be rewarded with excellent core gameplay. As a self-proclaimed noob who plays for a few weeks or months before taking a break and then returning, I find it easy to catch up and get back into the action. Experimenting with subclasses and creating a custom build that suits your playstyle is incredibly satisfying. The progression feels rewarding, and the journey itself is fun.\n",
      "\n",
      "For context, I rarely stick with games for long and only a handful have kept me engaged for more than 80 hours. Yet Destiny 2 continues to draw me back. Sure, I sometimes wander aimlessly, unsure which old quests to finish or abandon, but the moment your carefully theory-crafted build comes to life in combat—when explosions go off everywhere, and you’re not even sure why—it’s an exhilarating experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite its age, the game’s level design and artwork are stunning. Every planet and location is uniquely crafted and visually captivating. I can’t even pick a favorite. The sound design is equally impressive and deserves more recognition. Combined, these elements make the game as beautiful as it is immersive. And it performs superbly to boot. On top of that, exploration is usually rewarded, the age-old-recipe of any good open-world.\n",
      "\n",
      "The in-game shop is entirely optional unless you’re into cosmetics. Even then, you can earn many items through gameplay or buy them with in-game currency. Personally, I find the season passes worthwhile, offering useful items and components to make life easier. Importantly, there’s nothing you can only acquire with real money.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of Destiny 2’s standout features is Bungie’s API. Their official app is incredibly handy for tracking missions, finding groups, and more. Third-party apps and websites take it further, simplifying inventory management and armor crafting—features I absolutely love.\n",
      "\n",
      "I occasionally dabble in PvP or the PvPvE modes. While I’m terrible (and veterans probably see me as an easy target-practice), I still manage to have fun. Sometimes, I even top the leaderboard, which shows I’m not the only casual player around. The multiplayer experience is smooth and overall welcoming. Most missions are quick and cooperative, with minimal toxicity. Sure, experienced players might speed through objectives while you explore aimlessly, but the game ensures you’re teleported to key battles, so no one notices if you’re struggling.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s worth highlighting how incredibly fast you can find players for content, even for older activities that might seem \"dead.\" Most of the time, matchmaking works so seamlessly that you barely notice it’s real players being connected to your session almost instantly—regardless of the time or activity. For content that doesn’t support automatic matchmaking, you’ll need to manually find a group. Fortunately, the official app and in-game group finder make this process much easier. That said, I do wish there were more matchmaking options across the board to streamline the experience even further.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, my only real gripes are the long loading times and the sometimes clunky, console-oriented interface. Destiny 2 deserves better than its current “mixed” rating. It’s an amazing game that I wholeheartedly recommend—without any fanboy bias or buyer’s guilt. 😊\n",
      "115/2500 | detvidarr → I used to love this game, but it decayed, the classic content is gone, from PAID expansions. No respect for the players, their audience. There is no communication, there's only corporate essence inside. Game is dead for me.\n",
      "116/2500 | Hashmissbrauch → fully fine\n",
      "117/2500 | izzysworld → This game is not free. If you download the 'free' content, you will have no idea what you are playing thanks to Bungie literally vaulting a large amount of content. Unless you are going to buy each DLC just to keep up with a story in a dying game, there is no coherent story, you will not understand the game mechanics enough to not feel lost at least 50% of the time. i got the game early on and stopped playing for a while. i have over 600hrs in Destiny 2 on PS5. It was fun in its prime, but it is far far far away from its peak content days.

      "134/2500 | 76561198313600674 → Destiny 2 is a game that continues to walk the line between brilliance and frustration. Developed by Bungie, this online multiplayer first-person shooter blends tight gunplay, expansive sci-fi storytelling, and MMO-lite mechanics into a visually stunning package. Yet, years after launch, it still struggles with issues that often leave players torn between admiration and exhaustion.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Good:\n",
      "Let’s start with what Destiny 2 undeniably gets right—its gameplay is top-tier. Bungie’s pedigree in FPS design is unmistakable; shooting enemies feels crisp, impactful, and satisfying. Each weapon archetype is thoughtfully designed, and the sheer variety—from hand cannons to space-age bows—keeps combat fresh.\n",
      "\n",
      "The art direction and soundtrack are also highlights. Whether you're exploring the neon-soaked streets of Neomuna or the eerie caverns of the Moon, the game is consistently beautiful and atmospheric. Couple that with a rich, ever-expanding lore and some genuinely epic campaign moments, and Destiny 2 offers a sci-fi universe that’s easy to get lost in.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Mixed:\n",
      "Content delivery in Destiny 2 has evolved into a double-edged sword. On one hand, the seasonal model ensures a regular stream of new missions, gear, and story developments. On the other, this content is often fleeting, with key narrative beats and entire activities disappearing as seasons end—leaving newer players confused or left out.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bad:\n",
      "Then there's the grind. While Destiny 2 thrives on progression, it often leans too heavily on repetitive tasks, especially during seasonal content. The game sometimes mistakes time-consuming for rewarding, and the power level treadmill can feel more like a chore than a journey.\n",
      "\n",
      "Monetization is another sore spot. Between expansions, dungeon passes, seasons, and cosmetics, the cost of staying fully engaged with Destiny 2 adds up quickly. For a game that’s technically free-to-play, it often feels like a subscription service in disguise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Verdict:\n",
      "Destiny 2 is an exhilarating shooter wrapped in a gorgeous world, but it comes with caveats. If you're looking for fluid combat, epic space fantasy, and don’t mind some repetitive grind or piecemeal content delivery, there’s a lot to love here. Just be ready for some growing pains—and your wallet might feel it too. 7/10\n",
      "135/2500 | thatzetatho → Here's the thing: The game, if it's fun, is REALLY fun. The gunplay is amazing, the lore is great, the graphics are solid. As an aesthetic and creative package, the game is GOOD.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in its current state, I simply cannot recommend getting into it as a new player. Even as a returning player it's tough.\n",
      "\n",
      "Right this time (August '25) Bungie is trying to change the backbone of how the entire gameplay loop works, but the latest DLC drop (Edge of Fate) only implemented what looks like the backbone of the backbone. It's a barren, bug-riddled, work-in-progress that is lacking adaptation of older content and is pretty much completely explored within a matter of a month, if you're taking your time.\n",
      "\n",
      "You might not notice this as much if you get into the game fresh and have a lot of old content/story to catch up with first, but if you're keeping up with content as it releases, you're very quickly running out of things to do and the leftover \"grind loop\", as mentioned before, is barren. It feels like only 10% of existing content has been adapted into the new system (The Portal). This means you quickly run out of \"updated\" things to do, and if you go back to the old content you don't get any reward that is up to your player level. Essentially, you're locked into a loop of a handful of things that give you any rewards that matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then even those don't actually matter, because the current plan is soft-sunsetting the currently available gear with the release of the next expansion, when new gear is meant to take its place. So you're grinding simply for the sake of grinding, only to lose it all and start over again.\n",
      "\n",
      "The current gameplay loop respects neither your time, nor your dedication.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a new player getting into the game, this also means that none of the old content is up to date. You can play it for the story, but it will not reward you with armor or weapons that are \"featured\" in Bungie's current attempt at a gameplay loop. You'll end up hard-stuck unless you engage with the \"Portal\" mechanic, which - as mentioned before - is barren and unfinished.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's not even talking about the new player experience in general, including both gameplay and story.\n",
      "\n",
      "The game does not do a good job at introducing the mechanics, the setting, and the gameplay loop. It's easier to get into the game if you have people that you can play with that are willing and able to explain the intricacies/depth of the system to you. If you don't have friends, you need to do quite a lot of research, watch guides, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since Bungie removed the original launch story (\"The Red War\") as well as the first expansions (\"Curse of Osiris\", \"Warmind\", and 70% of \"Forsaken\") and *every single season that ever launched* between DLC drops, it's also incredibly difficult to get into the story/lore of the game and keep up with it. It's not impossible, but it requires both a lot of dedication and the use of outside sources like Youtube or a wiki.\n",
      "\n",
      "Until Bungie fixes the new player experience and introduces a gameplay loop that does not spit on your dedication, I can't recommend trying to get into the game.\n",
      "136/2500 | 76561199056780526 → The game currently runs very badly on PC, in addition it is with many failures, armor that must be deactivated, weapons that bungie removes them because they are broken, etc.The game shows that it is not at its best.Serious performance problems, FPS drop, pulls, play crucible, goes very badly, too many pulls and freezing despite having high -end PC and worst of all Bungie knows about the problems but does not give a date of solution.I think they must wait for all problems to subsay, but I honestly have very little faith in that company.It shows that they lack personal, especially in what has to do with the quality control of the game.A pity what became destiny 2.\n",
      "137/2500 | 76561198156981943 → Alright. After 6 days playing, I have to say that year 8 content is not that worse. Yes, this game lacks playable contents now, the new campaign is mediocre than year 5 and 7. It's a hard time for Destiny 2.\n",
      "But this game chose a better direction. Finally, BUNGIE began to learn reusing patrol world and make it re-playable for players. And the remake-equipment-system gives players motion to farm. That's how a online game should looks like. It's good to see such ops in the portal, not that hard, and can be fun with such selectable mods. And still, it needs some adjustment, especially in the balance of mods.\n",
      "BUNGIE can also bring Year 5, 6 and 7 campaign into the portal with selectable mods and various awards(for those paid players). Those old contents should not be just abandoned after new DLC's release. I mean, it's not possible for present BUNGIE to give 4 raids per year just like in Forsaken. It's more realistic to let BUNGIE use existing game assets to make some re-playable and funny activities. And when BUNGIE grows better, more like the old BUNGIE, then it's good to ask BUNGIE to give more NEW raids than just bring old things from DCV.\n",

      "Besides, devs decided to ♥♥♥♥ up exotics. Now they have a selected pool of exotics that you are encouraged to play with because they gain bonus damage and DR. What is the point of these changes ? You are NOT bringing up new buildcrafting options with this ♥♥♥♥.\n",

They also have now soft-sunsetted every piece of armour and weapons that players have gotten up this point for no reason and still want players to pay £80 or $100 dollars for a DLC that takes everything you have earned and gotten up this point and trows it away in the bin.

What was once a (mostly)polished game with amazing gun/gameplay is a shell of it's former self. Each update asks you to grind monotonous tasks to be able to play the mode/content you want. Sure there's fireteam power now, but that means your friend still has to play the worthless slop to get to the power level to let you into the activity you actually want to play. The most difficult thing in the game anymore is avoiding bugs/crashes and having the resilience to sit in a corner and plink the bullet sponge boss until you get your loot. I'll always love what this game was, but I can't recommend it the way that it is. It's a metric whoring cash-cow shell of what was once my favorite game.\n",

      "In addition, with the new revision of weapons and armor, the entire team that cost so much to achieve is obsolete from one day to another, becoming months - or even years - of Farmeo in time lying in the trash.\n",

      "If Bungie wants to implement such drastic changes that force veteran players to rebuild all progress, the coherent would be to launch a Destiny 3. impose it within an expansion of a title with so many years of travel not only makes no meaning, but it implies a lack of respect for the dedication of their community.\n",
      "195/2500 | Winjink → When I was in front of the screen late at night, I listened to my other five teammates shouting to let me work together to defeat the powerful boss deep in the raid, pressing my fingers mechanically and pulling the trigger, gunfire and laughter echoed in the quiet room - this is the most familiar and comfortable rhythm in the past five years.From the entry of the Silver Lin season in August 2020, high school to college, in these 3,000 hours of time, I seemed to have completed a migration journey that spanned a light-year distance, and also witnessed the ending of light and darkness.\n",
      "In the universe of Destiny 2, it was once the most magical mirror in my youth, reflecting my desire for the unknown, longing to explore, longing to conquer, and realize the heroic dream that is difficult to reach in reality.From the beginning of the raid's embarrassment to communicating with me, to the beginning of the mature raid, it was also reflected in my growing up from an ignorant boy to a boy who could stand alone. The encouragement and praise from my teammates filled the deep valley of my desire for recognition in my adolescence.However, when the virtual starry sea quietly recedes, the waves of reality finally hit ashore, I gradually realize the subtle misalignment between the game universe and the trajectory of reality.I once forgot to eat and sleep for a piece of equipment and fought all night for Dayone. Those achievements were as dazzling as light energy, but also as light energy as light energy, easily dissipated in the real dimension.Just like the title of \"Iron Smithman\" - Iron Smithman, the will of many tempers never cools down in the guardian forge. It has long surpassed the meaning of the game itself and taught me how we grow.\n",
      "But the river of time never flows in vain, and 3,000 hours of immersion are not futile voids.The communication skills cultivated when commanding the team, the resilience and patience tempered when attacking the dungeon, and even the calm review learned to face failures - these have long been deposited into portable power modules, silently embedded in the skeleton of my real life.I am also very grateful to the guild friends who have been traveling with me for a long time. From taking me to the Leviathan sewer to the Dayone struggle together, I never thought that time was so fast.\"Brothers, when the sound of Gaio's hammer is extinguished in the forge, when the pendulum of wisdom is no longer reversed - but our gun chamber is always pressing on each other's trust. In these five years, it is your light that has sewed my countless broken armor, and it is your fire support that makes the most desperate copy light up the stars. May we in reality always be like Leviathan in eternal night: even if we dive deep into the darkness, there are still stars burning in our chest. Although this body is dispersed, this aspiration is the same as entropy.\"\n",
      "When the witness was defeated, Destiny 2 was truly completed, just like my youth - it turns out that the one who really defeated in five years was not the Dark Pyramid, but the teenager who was afraid of the future in the high school classroom.At this moment, what was heavy in the backpack was not the dropped foreign equipment, but the key to courage for three thousand hours of tempering: it not only unlocked the end of the game, but also calibrated the ballistics of real life.\n",
      "It turns out that the so-called \"destiny\" does not only refer to the vast universe on the screen, but also an epic written by ourselves in the junction of virtuality and reality, using our will as the pen and time as the ink, and we write one stroke by one.When the light energy in the game fades away like a tide, the corners in the heart that have been illuminated by it will be eternal - it not only illuminates the galaxy, but also the pilgrimage journey of how young people transform into humans.\n",

My favourite part of a game was finding a team or joining together with my friends to conquer some dungeons or raids, as it was the pinnacle of everything you done prior.

The only content worth doing is just running the same missions over and over again, until you reach a new power level to do the same mission but slightly harder. And that's it. That grind no longer leads to any meaningful content. You just grind to grind, not grind to play something more interesting. That completely ruined the game for me and everyone else.\n",

These contents are very interesting at the beginning, and it is no problem to taste them briefly.\n",
      "but!Please don’t spend a few hundred yuan to buy the latest DLC, and don’t spend time and energy to brush equipment, because in the end everything you pay will be denied by Bungie.\n",

      "However, you can't review Destiny without talking about the full picture. Playing Destiny today is not the same as release.

It feels like the game has become less about living out that power fantasy and more about an endless, soul-crushing power grind. Remember when hitting max light actually made you feel like an unstoppable Guardian? Now, with all these \"Edge of Fate\" changes—the seasonal power caps and artifact power—it feels like I'm perpetually underpowered, no matter how much I play.\n",

      "Every new season, my hard-earned power levels essentially get wiped, forcing me to grind for hours just to get back to where I was, let alone feel dominant. This isn't progression; it's a treadmill. It completely robs me of that feeling of being a god-slaying Guardian, replacing it with the nagging sense that I'm just trying to keep my head above water. The \"Edge of Fate\" system is at the heart of this sad story for our power fantasy. While the artifact gives a temporary boost, it's fleeting, and the seasonal cap means new content always puts me at a disadvantage.\n",

      "\n",
      "Devalued Gear: All the effort I put into getting perfectly rolled weapons and armor feels pointless when my power level is constantly being reset or capped. Why chase that god-roll if it's kneecapped next season?\n",
      "\n",
      "Loss of Agency: It feels like my individual skill or clever buildcrafting matters less than just hitting some arbitrary power level by doing repetitive chores. My choices feel less impactful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Grind Fatigue: Honestly, I'm just exhausted by the endless grind. The reward isn't actually feeling powerful; it's just being \"less underpowered\" for a brief window.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's such a shame because Destiny 2 still has amazing gunplay, satisfying abilities, and a truly rich universe. But the current power system completely overshadows those strengths, transforming what should be an epic power fantasy into a relentless, unrewarding chore. I just wish we could go back to a system where reaching max power actually felt empowering, and the challenge came from engaging mechanics, not just an arbitrary power deficit.

Unlimited trash waves who hits like a truck just to piss you off. I forgot about autoaim enemies; they cant see you, but they can shoot you, very often you dont even know what to kill you, even through walls.

The announcement of the marathon and the failure of various lawsuits proved that Bangji never wanted to save Destiny 2. He just kept squeezing the player's passion and the last drop of blood of Destiny 2. When he realized this, as I just said, there was not much trouble. In fact, the player had known it for a long time, but the player was still fantasizing before he got the answer.

It's clear to me that Bungie cannot be trusted at all at their word, they are not balancing the game intelligently, instead preferring to turn knobs for the sake of inciting outrage and just to change for change's sake, pushing out stories that rely on cheap shock and narrative decisions that are immediately reversed or played off, and their systems are constantly changed to disrespect player time and investment, treating the fans like mindless fools that will simply support the brand no matter how badly bungie fumbles or spits in their faces.

I've played comp, gone flawless in trials many times, and done almost everything in between when it comes to pvp, and I've gilded Conqueror a few times, regularly playing through GM Nightfalls, running Raids with friends, teaching people Raids and Dungeons, and even solo'd dungeons and nightfalls. I am not writing this review simply because of one single instance that bungie mildly inconvenienced me with a business decision or balance change i didn't like; this has been years of tolerating declining quality in the hopes of a strong second wind from the studio, and giving in to sunk cost, playing through the finale of the story i'd been following since 2014, and realizing bungie struggled to even get to this point without having jettisoned damn near everything i cared about along the way, and seeing that now that the story has concluded, they have nothing in the tank but half baked ideas and more poor decisions when it comes to how to balance this game and keep players engaged. once again, i am done. No more keyjangling, no stupid crossovers to try desperately to keep people engaged, no intentional releases of weapons and abilities that are intentionally unbalanced and broken to force interaction with this game and it's systems. It's over. I want to see the studio cleaned out and the game given a complete revamp before I consider coming back here again.\n",

      "338/2500 | EclipseStalvok → Destiny, since Beyond Light, has become a \"you had to be there\" kind of game. With how much I played, I saw that Bungie had hit alot of high notes but the low notes were lower than I've ever seen. I love this franchise and I want it to continue but the issue is that their split with Activision, while good for creativity, saw them have more and more low notes. The drip fed content was agonizing. I understand the limitations of the engine it's on (the same as the original Destiny, so almost 10) but I think it's time to upgrade. It's built for console first and PC second. Take a couple years off and redo the whole thing in a new engine. After The Final Shape, I really lost interest. I understand they want to keep the game going but there's a point where it needs to end.\n",
      "\n",
      "I loved this game. I really did. It kept me going at my lowest points and helped me develop patience. In its current state, it's not something I really wanna continue playing. I gave my time. I did what I needed to do. The constant grinding was taking a real toll on my mental health. I can only play the same mission so many times before it gets boring and repetitive like the raids. I guess I finally hit my limit and I have no interest in the future of this game. Maybe if Marathon takes off, they won't have to rely on low effort updates, more emotes, event cards, and ornaments to keep them afloat.\n",

      "With the latest update and DLC (Edge of Fate), this game has dive-bombed in quality. Those familiar with Destiny will know quality tends to dip when Bungie decides they know best. Spoiler: they don't.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The core gameplay loop now revolves around grinding the same dozen or so missions to get gear, mostly alone. You start at 10 Power (Gear Score), and need to make your way to 200, which is the current permanent maximum. While grinding to 200, you will find Tier 1 and 2 gear, which is useless. Tier 1 armor has the lowest stats, and T1 weapons cannot be enhanced so even if you find an accidental godroll it'll be subpar. Tier 2 gear is just as uselss, as is Tier 3, though the system is implemented to have most players (i.e. You) settle with Tier 3 gear as \"good enough\". This means two things:\n",
      "1) That nearly all the gear you find, if not actually ALL GEAR, will be disappointing.\n",
      "2) The bulk of your time will be spent wasting time, alone, grinding the same thing over and over to pump up Bungie's engagement.\n",
      "\n",
      "- I mentioned before that 200 is the current permanent maximum gear score. The actual maximum overall gear score is 500, which is meant strictly for the hardest core players (and no-lifers such as myself). On your way to 500, you will find Tier 3 gear (again, useless and disappointing) and transition eventually into Tier 4 and Tier 5 gear, the highest Tiers. These are the only Tiers that matter, offering you actual benefits for using that tier such as additional perk options and mod slots. However, if your power is above 200 when the next DLC releases (every 6 months), you will be reduced to 200 and any materials you had to push above 200 will be removed from your account. Furthermore, since a new DLC will offer new items, all items gained previously will not receive the arbitrary \"this is new\" buff which fundamentally unbalances the game. Any item more than 6 months old will, due to Bungie's need to sell products, do less damage and protect you less. This is Bungie once again toeing the line with P2W tactics, much like their failed microtransaction that sold Exotic-level equipment. TL;DR:\n",
      "1) Your power, materials, and gear will reset on a biannual basis, which for any new players or casual players means you will never make significant progress.\n",
      "2) You need to farm for days or weeks of time to have a chance of finding even a single worth-while item.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Endgame content such as Raids still reward Tier 1 armor until you've crossed a certain threshold.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The vast majority of Destiny 2's content is gone. There is no \"vanilla campaign\" (named The Red War), it was removed with the Sunsetting update years ago. There is no old DLC campaign, those were removed as well. Previously purchased content has been removed from the game as they slowly introduced seasonal content and, with this last update, the *vast* majority of content is now useless as it doesn't drop new gear. That's right, a game with nearly a decade of content essentially has none that you'd want to play. To be clear, this means 10 Dungeons (most of which were paid for), 12 Raids, and 2 Raid Lairs (mini raids) are either not in the game anymore or don't give current-era useful gear. You can still get gear from it, but because of the the buff given to new gear, it is effectively useless.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The new player experience is notoriously bad, and the devs are either uninterested or powerless to change it. You'll be thrown into a world that refuses to explain itself, playing a game that takes at least 3 different youtube channels, a couple fan-made sites and an app to play effectively, and more time studying than a master's degree. As a player since the first Destiny Beta, it's still hard to keep up with every little thing. The perks do not give you numbers when it comes to anything at all, so its up to you and the internet to discover how much a \"moderate increase in damage\" is and how many exceptions there are to the rule. This game is taxing in more ways than one.\n",
      "\n",
      "- It used to be better. Before this update, we could find viable armor almost anywhere. Weapons could be found and, even if the particular roll you got wasn't good, you could craft a lot of them with the exact perks you wanted. You could even enhance the perks of found weapons if you did get a godroll. This was done to cut down on the grind that players hated and wasted time. Endgame activities gave endgame gear, you were rewarded for your time spent and your skill in playing and buildcrafting. It was never a perfect game, but it was far, far more respectful of players' time and far less predatory.\n",
      "\n",
      "To recap, do not under any circumstance, play this game in it's current state. It's a waste of your time. They've taken a decade of player feedback and thrown it out the window for simple greed and pure ego.

I made a decision to wait until I upgraded my PC and display before starting this game knowing this would be receiving updates with additional content for years. When I finally did so and came back to play the game, I found myself entering the equivalent of walking into a movie halfway through the film having the most vaguest idea as to what is going on because Bungie has proven they do not care about their games or the gamers that play them by cutting out and locking away the entire first half of this game leaving you to start halfway through. So yea, no way to go back now and I see no reason to pay for any of the paid content as a result. This must have been one of the worst decisions a gaming company has ever made, when they simply could have bought more servers to host both and had gamers transfer their chars over to the second half of the game even if it would lock that character out of the second half of the game.

Now they're just milking the game dry and treating the player-base like dumb little sheep as they string us along with the promise of better content that continues to be mediocre and buggy messes.

These changes do not reward the player with any tangible benefit, essentially turning leveling into a \"proof of effort\" that is required to enter higher-level content. All higher-level content has forced power restrictions, making every enemy in that content feel like a bullet sponge that can 2-tap you, and you cannot over-level content to feel stronger. All old gear has been essentially soft-sunset, as the leveling process benefits new gear, and many endgame activities have a strict requirement for you to equip all new gear to access it. This update made the game a hellish grind-simulator and has alienated the casual audience that has kept it alive year after year, and I don't see it surviving without a truly biblical course correction to undo this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mess.\n",
      "\n",
      "As of writing this, we are currently on patch 9.0.0.3 of The Edge of Fate and, I gotta say, this is probably the worst state the game has ever been in. Worse than Year 1, worse than Lightfall, and worse than any point in Destiny 1. It's depressing, man.\n",
      "\n",
      "At its core, Destiny's moment-to-moment gameplay is some of the best of any FPS that I've ever played. The gunplay is clean and responsive, the abilities are flashy and powerful, the sound design is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ juicy, and don't get me started on the MUSIC. Being in an activity and actually fighting enemies and getting through encounters is incredibly fun. It's everything outside of that core gameplay experience that has been utterly decimated by this latest update.\n",
      "\n",
      "The update introduced a new leveling mechanic, a new gear quality system, a new activity playlist system, and a new reward structure. The new gear leveling mechanic, much like the gear score you'd find in any MMO on the market, increases your character's power level based on the average level of your equipped gear; the old system did this too, but the new power system is not equal in function. The level is used entirely as a \"you must be this tall to ride\" metric, and not as any actual measurement of the relative strength of your character. Once you hit the power requirement for an activity, you are locked to that power level any time you enter that activity (an enforced \"power delta\", a fixed gap in levels between you and the enemies you face). This wouldn't be so bad, except for the fact that as you enter higher-tier activities, power delta becomes greater and greater; as that difference in power level increases, you deal less damage but take more damage. The game does not reward the player's effort to raise their level by letting them actually, y'know, feel more powerful; it merely unlocks new and creative ways to get your ♥♥♥♥ stomped in activities that you've done before.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new gear tier system is literally just a reskin of an item rarity system (common, uncommon, rare, legendary, etc) that the game already has. Bungie promised that old gear would still be viable to use, but in the new reward structure, you get a hefty bonus for every piece of new (from this patch) gear that you equip, essentially making your old gear worthless during the leveling process.\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking of leveling, I forgot to mention that the level cap for the next 3 months is 450 power. For each completion of a really valuable activity that might take 20-ish minutes, you get a power gain of (roughly) 2, if that. Once the Ash and Iron update comes out in September, the level cap will increase to 550. Then December rolls around. Then the next \"expansion\" (season by any other name) releases and we're all reset back to 200 power, wiping out any progress we've made in 6 months and changing the gear that counts as \"new gear\" so we have to grind it out all over again, ad infinitum. I, personally, refuse to engage with this asinine and poorly-implemented leveling system, since it appears to be worse in every way from the previous design.\n",

      "541/2500 | Enniebodie → This games gameplay feels amazing. However, with how they \"updated\" the game I can't recommend it to anyone. Bungie has made a game that is suppose to make players feel that they can progress their gear and skills to tackle the end game content. Yet, with the edge of fate if you are not gunning to be in the top 0.1% of players in skill the endgame is unattainable for the rest of the player base. Therefore, the amount of things a player can do is severely limited and will miss out on a huge amount of content that they have paid for. If you want a casual game or even a game with a challenge, but not incredibly challenging D2 is not the game to play. Unless you learn an encyclopedia of information that you'll need to figure out through resources outside of the game you will come into this game feeling overwhelmed and have no clue where to go to get out of that feeling. Congrats Bungie not only did you mess up Marathon, but now your ostracized a huge majority of your player base that gives you money and all i see is a game dying a slow death.\n",

Don't download if it's poor, if it's rich throw it to the fullest without spending a Tustão and only then can you think of spending inside it, but just thinking.There are many other games with larger or similar content than Destiny and the free game closest to it and more free to play is Warframe, this I recommend testing\n",

Over time, however, problems in both the game and the company making it have mounted to the point where it's impossible to play without thinking that maybe the thousands of hours you've put into the game may have been better spent in more productive and healthy pursuits. Sweaty PVP lobbies, cheaters abound, a wholly abandoned game mode (Gambit), seasonal content that becomes entirely too repetitive, stagnant PVE, and paid DLC content that's been locked behind \"Sunsetting\" that as revealed in recent PLAGARISM lawsuits, is now wholly unavailable to consumers at large.

SO many things wrong with the Edge of Fate launch, the new portal system (Whoever designed that should be fired) The removal of crafting, enhancing, and the removal of deepsight harmonizers from battlepass. The limitation of bright dust to a measly 1030 per week, I'm not sure why they removed pathfinder after they JUST introduced it in The Final Shape. There are several other reasons as well. This game feels like a slog of a grind now that you will have to repeat with every new season. Feels like Devs took all the love out of the game and replaced it with everything to keep players grinding away and spending money in eververse. This stupid corporatization of the game will be it's downfall.\n",

Other games have given options to install or uninstall content they are or aren't using all the time, especially MMOs that the game is trying to be like. There's so much of my money that's gone into thin air because they've done virtually nothing to compensate for removing content, and still charge for \"packs\" of scraps of the content they remove.

The game is free to try, and though a lot of it is locked behind some big purchases, I can tell you that it has been worth it over the years.

Long story short I found out that it was because my Bungie account wasn't age verified . So I gave my information on there website my age and date of birth. I received an email saying that they are looking into it . But I would have to provide a copy of GOVERNMENT PHOTO ID! With the promise of redacting my info as soon as they confirm my age. Lets see, government Id is usually what ,a drivers licence with a photo and my address height weight ect. Why don't I just DOX myself. Identity theft is not common these days is it? If this is going to be a trend for gaming companies to require then gamers all over the world need to take notice and offence to this. Bad enough they steal our data but now they put it behind feature within a game.

      "Destiny 2 PvP has some of the best mechanics I’ve ever felt in a shooter. But despite that, I keep walking away from it angry, frustrated, or just asking why I even bothered. My main focus has always been **Comp**—and honestly, it’s a mess.\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Competitive Isn't Competitive**\n",
      "Comp is supposed to be where skill matters, but it rarely feels that way. There’s no visible rank progression worth caring about, and the matchmaking is all over the place. You either get rolled by a full-stack or destroy a team that shouldn’t even be in your lobby. There’s no tension, no thrill—just unbalanced, sweat-heavy matches that feel like chores.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Lobby Balancing is a Joke**\n",
      "Destiny routinely throws solo players into uneven teams or puts drastically mismatched players together. You’ll go from being top frag in a close match to being bottom of the scoreboard in a complete blowout because the lobby made zero sense. There’s no real system trying to keep matches fair, especially in Comp, where it should matter most.\n",

      "**3. Hand Cannons Still Dominate, and It’s Tired**\n",
      "I’ve said it before: I’m sick of hand cannons. They’re always the fallback weapon, with insane lethality and forgiving TTK. It’s boring to fight against and feels like every loadout comes down to “what’s your favorite hand cannon?” I want variety, not forced meta worship.\n",

      "* You stomp.\n",
      "* You get stomped.\n",
      "Very few matches actually feel fair or engaging. The system doesn’t seem to care about maintaining a decent skill range—it just throws players together and hits start. Especially in solo Comp, it becomes a mental grind instead of fun competition.\n",
      "\n",
      "**5. No Incentive to Play, No Respect for Your Time**\n",
      "There’s no real reward for playing PvP. Nothing meaningful to chase. Even when I *do* have a good match, I don’t walk away feeling like I earned anything—or improved. There’s no satisfying progression or recognition. It’s just a loop that eats your time.\n",

And worst of all, there's no reason to keep playing. It’s hard to enjoy a mode that clearly isn’t being taken seriously by the people who built it.\n",

They have now added gear set bonuses and gear quality tiers. So if you want to be competitive you need perfect stats, perfect quality tier and perfect gear set bonus. all things that can't be transferred between gear sets.

Final Shape had a pinnacle cap of 20+ compared to Edge of Fate with a cap of 250+!!!! Bungie made a point of giving players “agency” but lock/focus what content is needed to power up rather than doing the right thing by letting players gain power anywhere they want or give boosted gear to higher difficulty content outside of the portal to make the grind more enjoyable. Sony honestly needs to go scorched earth on bungie. Love the game and community but dislike bungies direction. Edge of Fate was my last straw along and gone is any little trust I had left for bungie.

While i'm grateful that the company has *sometimes* listened to feedback (let's be honest here, no one was interested in Marathon, not even Bungie themselves), I think it needs to be said that new expansions with ham-fisted mechanics that won't be utilized outside of said expansions need to go the way of the dinosaur. I'm not delusional in thinking that Destiny will go on for another ten plus years, but I do think that the game needs to be treated with more reverence and care as it gets on in years and smashing new, half-baked content into it isn't what the game needs.\n",

      "Erasing of the stories THAT YOU HAVE BUY from previous year with the excuse that it doesn't take too much place but its still a 130gb game of 20 map max with reuse asset everywhere and with the cutscene in 1080p max.\n",
      "\n",
      "DIFFICULTY: Their definition of difficulty is a crazy number of enemy with literal invulnerability and when their a not they give you some mid level boss really tanky with the invulnerability for exemple i played a mission and the first mini boss was a tanky guy with a machine gun that doesn't have down time and didn't need to reload and mid life he got invulnerability while keeping his machine gun.\n",
      "And the fact that most of the enemy are the exact same: either some orc like creature with just a skin an insect like ennemie with skin or android ball where it just some skin between them and of course the fact that there all act the exact same the orc the insect or the android are just copy with each other with skin and some element attack and resistance.\n",
      "\n",
      "GAMEPLAY: The jetpack is horrible. It is a toggle jetpack.. !!a toggle jetpack!!! In almost 10 years they didn't make it user friendly and you bounce everywhere but in all it is almost the only big problem with the gameplay itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "HUD: OH GOD even ubisoft and ea have a better hud, menu, map and it is horrible. For a new player it dont make sense since they are absolutely no continuity and order in the quest (you can start the game, finish the tuto and do the last quest available) you have in the same place story quest, repeatable quest, the challenge and there is no difference in the aesthetics of them. So most of my play time when I thought I was doing some story mission, I was in reality doing an annex mission that kind of helped you learn how to play.\n",
      "For the menu most of them are useless and you will have a lot of shortcut for the same thing, while some of them (if you are on keyboard) some will be point and click with is the normal way with a mouse and keyboard while with some of them you will have to use your WASD to have access to some part of the menu.\n",
      "The map is also bad. Some big missions are only accessible on the map so the menu called QUEST doesn't have all the quests you will have to go on your map, find your mission in it then activate it. The minimap isn't better, it's just useless, never had one good information given by it.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE OTHER STUFF: The game is empty and don't feel alive event though on some mission there are some parcours between two point most of the time you will just run and jump through some big ahh corridor and the game isn't ugly but damn the landscape it is the only actual thing they did good when you don't look at every writing on screen that became pixelated when you move(i play the game in ultra 170 fps so no it isn't a problem on my end).\n",

      "Cons:\n",
      "-------------------------------------------------\n",
      "• Can no longer focus previous competitive weapons. Even though Bungie did mention that they were going to be able to be purchase from Xur - was still under the impression we'd be able to focus previously released comp weapons. The first reason why comp no longer feels viable to play. Second being\n",
      "• No longer able to get comp weapons after weekly 3 matches. Did my 7 placement matches, got a decent roll of the new weapon. Waited for the next week and ran my next 3 thinking I'd get another roll....nope. Now is a chance to drop. So as a casual PVP Paul, this defeats any reason to play comp anymore.\n",
      "• Stats incorrectly working. Bungie did state they were aware and would be fixing. We shall see.\n",
      "• \"Seasonal-post-200-power reset.\" This was the exact same reason I stopped playing Diablo. Feels worse for some reason than losing seasonal content. At least that give me a reason to play. Speaking of seasonal content...\n",
      "• No new endgame content minus raid. How about perpetually farming the same exotic missions from the past few years?\n",
      "• Cannot enhance new weapons? Have to • rely on RNG drops? As much as I loved crafting, at least being able to enhance weapons from TFS was not as bad. Now purely have to rely on RNG. but only realistically after...\n",
      "• Tier 3-5 drops unavailable until past 400/450? Even after 3K hours, having a full time job and a wife and home life...I just don't have the time nor the want to realistically play this game as my only game to get to that power + time for farming said weapons and armor within the 6 months. Another reason Bungie does not respect their players time...\n",
      "• Pathfinder gone, new system feels more ass/trash. Used to have a way to farm bright dust, but yet again - Bungie has found a way to cap resource farming. They stated they will fix. We shall see\n",
      "• DPS hit numbers lowered. This is a minor thing, but I miss seeing DPS within the millions. Going from slaying Gods with millions of damage...to tens/low hundreds of thousands is pretty demeaning feeling.\n",
      "• Being under power in old dungeons and raids, can't just breeze through them anymore. It's old content with weapons that are not AS viable now with tiered weapons. What is the literal point of this? oh, engaging more play time.\n",
      "• No more deepsight harmonizers. Cool, Bungie. I get you want to remove crafting, but let us finish what we're still missing. please.\n",
      "• In game economy has gone to ♥♥♥♥. Enhancement cores new legendary shards, likely until a new bug to easily farm them is introduced - then those will get replaced too. Calling it now.\n",
      "• New weapon archetypes behind paywalls. Not super upset at this, but from what I've read the RA Pulse is hard to farm and the heavy crossbow is locked behind the raid anyways. Odd for them to have teased that in a vidoc...\n",
      "• Speaking of raid, over half the teams that finished contest were cheaters? Is there a point to BattleEye? if not, can I install this on my Steam OS Devices, please?\n",
      "• Speaking of cheaters, still rampant clearly in PvE and PvP. but oh, wait. Marathon gets all the nice dedicated servers and all. Hopefully they'll move those back to D2 when Marathon flops.\n",
      "• Spoils of Conquest in new raid are locked behind modifiers? Neat, make the new raid harder for common drops from previous raids. yikes.\n",
      "• Bungie's new idea of making things difficult: enormous health pools. Banes and things are cool, but prioritize that. Not making bullet sponges that still live after\n",
      "• No more legend/master lost sectors? I liked farming mats and exotics through here on my breaks at work. Solo ops just does not fill that void at all.\n",
      "• Time gating. Still time gating. Perpetual Complaint, but still seems to be a thing. oof.\n",
      "• Trials reverted back. As an average pvp joe (over 1.0 KD) I enjoyed the trials changes over the past two seasons. Just getting 7 wins, no matter the losses, gave you the adept. Now? no longer. Gotta be Guardian Rank 9, LL 350-450, 850 credit score, and 7 full wins no losses at an chance at tier 5 loot. Why did we revert on this, Bungie? I promise, it was not those changes that dropped the player count - but the growing number of cheaters in your game that continue to plague the pool. Now with these loot changes, that pool will shrink even more so.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bungie, please please fix this. Franchise has been alive for over a decade, majority of us are parents, employed, spouses, etc. We no longer have that free time needed to play this as you would like.\n",

      "879/2500 | SpieleweltYT → I looked at Destiny 2's new update and would like to share my impressions - there are definitely some good, but unfortunately also many disappointing aspects.\n",
      "\n",
      "Positive: The new story brings fresh content into play, and there are a few new weapons and armor that are definitely fun.Adjusting activities has also been improved - it is noticeable that you have tried to give the players more flexibility.The portal activities are particularly emphasized-solidly designed, even if they essentially include “only” revised maps with well-known opponents and the typical zone holding.\n",
      "\n",
      "Negative: the story, although new, looks rather boring and not captivating.I find the exchange of some well -known voice actors - for example, with vagabonds and Ana Bray.I really hope that Savathûn is not affected, because the previous voices have contributed strongly to the atmosphere.\n",
      "\n",
      "A real mood killer is the soundtrack: it looks very uniform overall.None of the boss fights have their own musical style - instead you hear a kind of endless loop with slightly cut sections.That takes up their charm many scenes.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are also returns in the rewards and systems: Gloss dust can only be farled through daily tasks or weekly rewards - before that, this was much better, for example through the scout.The new armor set bonuses are nothing that really tears me off the stool.In addition, new craftable weapons are completely missing, which is frustrating.Instead, you have to make room in the safe again to collect all the new weapons and armor - a well -known problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also disappoint me that no new strike has been added to Kepler.The new raid is strongly reminiscent of the pantheon - which means: no puzzles, no special moments, but only boss mechanics until the damage phase.That feels anything but new.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bugs are still available, and you already have the feeling that the next nerf is not long in coming.\n",
      "\n",
      "The world levels?Basically, you only repeat the campaign, supplemented by one or two areas in which you have to collect capsules - this is rather tedious than exciting.And the vanguard?With the exception of Ikora, there is currently hardly a role in the overall events, which I think is a shame.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Conclusion:\n",
      "After almost 11,000 hours of play with Destiny 2, I can say with a clear conscience that it was a great gaming experience until The Final Shape was completed.But for me, the negative aspects currently predominate, as described above, and that's why I will first distance myself from the game.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, I hope that future seasons and events will bring more quality and variety again - because the potential is still there.If nothing changes, I will probably limit my season to the bare essentials - for example for certain successes, triumphs or the targeted farm of gloss dust.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, I am happy to continue to support \"new lights\" and my clan as a supporter.😊\n",

Pure cerebral palsy design. This kind of cerebral palsy game planning should be shot and apologized. You are not suitable for developing games. I used to be the most annoying to RPG game design decryption elements. You are so clever. I think I am awesome. I play games to make fun of it. I don’t have time to pass the main line. I also look at the strategy. 2. Half of the tasks are played without showing the path points. Let the players guess. I can go to you, fuck you, I can’t be played by the game. 3. The difficulty and difficulty are directly piled up monsters. In 18, the first few DLC monsters in 2019, the design mechanism is that the distance is farther, the worse the accuracy of the monsters. Now there is no brainer to add value, and the far away monsters lock the head directly. 4. I heard that Bangji Studio advocates the rainbow flag policy. Is this the reason for the shit game you do?

The recent DLC's have also been lacking in quality as well.

Bungee gave every player like me the biggest ♥♥♥♥ you when they removed all the content I had paid for to \"make room for new content.\" At that point, just make Destiny 3. The new DLCs weren't even worth it, with worse and worse story, more repetitive missions, and campaigns that got shorter and shorter.\n",

Also DLCs now costs ~$39-$80 now despite content generally being disappointing. if you're paying 40 dollars for a FTP experience....its not FTP.\n",

The original Red War campaign, and the first 4 expansions offered interesting stories, great characters, and compelling game play. But all those are gone now...

I came back in 2025 because the steam summer sale had all the dlc for a good price and it included the \"annual pass\" that ENDS IN A WEEK and removes all the content. It should be illegal, absolute scum at Bungie. This game is pay to win far beyond anything else in the genre on top of paid expansions. everything is power crept with the newest content and then they simply remove all that content from the game when it most benefits them financially. The meues and systems are beyond convoluted, The stories are generally uninteresting with every plot point being exposition from your ghost and never actually shown through NPC interactions. Armor and weapon perks are very bland compared to other looter shooters that just come down to dps through damage, rate of fire and reload speed because they are too lazy to have to worry about differing animations and multi projectile calculations and the things people generally have come to expect from unique weapons in looter-shooters.\n",

      "1080/2500 | sundownmarktwo → Lord only knows how much I've stuck with this game, but it's pretty clear that Bungie has well and truly fumbled the bag. It is nearly impossible to onboard new players into the game with the disaster that is the New Light campaign, and even harder to maintain the motivation of friends who would want to play the game with you. Systems that were intended to help players enjoy the game keep getting walked back time and again, and core repeatable game systems have been left to languish in complete irrelevancy.\n",
      "\n",
      "While systems teased for the upcoming \"Year of Prophecy\" stand to resolve some of these issues, Bungie will need to do more than a mild overhaul to how they handle their content. Building the game around \"you had to be there for it\" moments, combined with managerial ineptitude and an unwillingness to do the right thing for the game's health results in Bungie constantly letting the game go right to the brink before they do some sweeping Hail Mary change that makes the game fun to play again for a short time before the cycle inevitably repeats.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's such a shame that the core moment-to-moment gameplay - the guns, the abilities, the general feel when you get to properly hard content - is weighed down by an overarching design strategy that is slowly suffocating a game that truly felt like it was recovering and had a positive future back during the era of Witch Queen.\n",

      "Destiny 2 is, without question, a visually stunning game. Its world design, music, and gunplay are top-tier—Bungie knows how to craft a game that feels good to play. But after years of chasing the Light, it’s hard to ignore the truth: this game has lost its way.\n",
      "\n",
      "What once felt like an ambitious, evolving universe has become a bloated live-service treadmill, filled with arbitrary systems, recycled content, and an exhausting seasonal grind. The joy of discovery has been replaced by checklists. The excitement of new loot has been dulled by time-gated upgrades, endless materials, and power caps that reset your progress every few months.\n",
      "\n",
      "Content that used to define the Destiny experience—like full campaigns or strikes—is now hidden behind paywalls or outright removed (sunset), leaving gaps in the story and frustration for returning players. Free-to-play users are given a stripped-down version of the game, with little meaningful content and frequent reminders to open their wallets.\n",
      "\n",
      "The narrative, while occasionally brilliant, often feels disjointed and buried under lore tabs and seasonal cutscenes. If you miss a season, you’re out of the loop—and good luck catching up. The storytelling is no longer about epic moments shared by the community; it’s about timed content you can miss if life gets in the way.\n",
      "\n",
      "PvP is barely supported. Crucible has received little meaningful attention in years, and balance issues, lag, and stale playlists continue to plague the experience. Gambit, once a promising hybrid mode, has been left to rot.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps the most disheartening part is how Destiny 2 constantly demands more of your time while offering less in return. Everything is a grind—seasons, bounties, currencies, power levels. The game feels more like a part-time job than a hobby. And while some players may find satisfaction in the loop, many others are simply burnt out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Destiny 2 had light, had promise, had heart. But somewhere along the way, it got lost in its own systems, its own monetization strategy, and its own inability to let players simply play. It’s still beautiful—but beauty alone can’t carry a game forever.\n",

Now it's all style for micro-transactions, though tbf some of the stuff you can get looks gorgeous and cool. Some of it. Not most of it, and even then the good stuff is not worth the $20 they charge for one outfit.

We fought in the Red War together, faced 'Big Daddy Calus'.

The introduction of the Black Armory, the additional gamemodes in Gambit and on the Leviathan, and even having the spotlight shone back on older expansions like Curse of Osiris and Warmind.

Despite its label as a free to play game, most of the game is actually unplayable unless you pay, totalling up to hundreds of dollars (even without purchasing the annual pass versions). And by the looks of things, the amount of money you'll have to invest into a story that now feels disjointed in comparison to before, now looks to be more and more expensive.\n",

      "1151/2500 | kaitoasuke → Despite the thousands of hours I've played in both Destiny and Destiny 2, the franchise has suffered from bad management from their C-suite. Ultimately, the best talents within Bungie have slowly bled out and left within the decade of the franchise's lifespan. The few veteran developers left are trying to keep the game afloat, so while the overall gameplay is a mostly pleasant experience; the new-player experience is awful and unhelpful (something the devs know and still fail to solve), the reward-gameplay loop grind is predatory and forceful (one of the main metrics is player-retention time a.k.a. how long one stays playing the game) wherein mathematicians and content creators proved that Bungie's loot algorithm was performing as intended and after a decade of gaslighting the community finally realized the community was right.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lore and story for the most part have been entertaining and wondrous, though the last few expansions have been marred with overambitious intentions and failing to address the issue of new and returning players who missed on the story. THEN THERE'S SUNSETTING AND THE DESTINY CONTENT VAULT. What other game anywhere just deletes or removes content you paid for?! Beyond the low amount of narrative replayability, the seasonal content caused narrative gaps between annual expansions that requires players to watch videos on YouTube because Bungie's gamer culture is about encouraging FOMO and \"you had to have been there\" mentality that ultimately just creates an awful experience. The original explanation was that it was reduce the game's overall file size, an issue that has plague modern game development due in small part to the lack of of resources and time for developers to properly optimize their games. Whether it could've been solved with dedicated servers (a request from the community for years) remains uncertain. In other modern games where game size has become an issue, we've seen some games have the ability to turn off expansions to reduce space. Unfortunately, Destiny can't do that since every location may occasionally be necessary and since the subclass content is tied to owning expansions and content completion, there's no easy way to separate the two without a complete rework.\n",

      "Destiny 2 is an MMO gacha game that has none of the quality of life improvements from those genres. The lack of a ping system has made it difficult for players to communicate outside of voice chat or in-game text. Given the fast action nature of the game being mostly a first-person shooter, the developers provided the two least effective forms of communication and collaboration. It's harrowing that after 8 years of Destiny 2 that a marking or ping system has not been implemented. Sure you can say that it's a limitation within the game engine code, but Bungie has updated that game engine several times in the past decade and yet still managed to miss the mark. The monetization is abundant, we get that, but the real issue is that when it comes to Bungie's priorities regarding monetization: in 2024, several instances when an oversight resulted in free or reduced prices for microtransaction content resulted in immediate resolution versus game-breaking glitches and bugs that took anywhere from 3 months to nearly 300 days after release to resolve. Yes, some issues and problems require more effort and time to resolve and develop a fix, but the communications from Bungie paints an image of a developer who is more concerned about protecting their smallest profit margins over the good faith of their long-time community. As a result, the game population has dwindled substantial than when I returned to the franchise during Beyond Light with its peak around the time of the Witch Queen and just before the Lightfall expansions.\n",

      "The developers also are understaffed due to poor project management from the upper execs reallocating developer resources into other projects. In the past 5 years, the developer has been working on up to 4-5 projects with 3 of them scrapped, 1 being a collaboration with another developer, and 1 that's sitting in a marketing limbo due to their game assets using stolen artwork (see Marathon controversy for more info). Because of the poor allocation of resources, the developers can only force on one and a half aspects of the game at most. With their main priority being PVE content and making sure the sandbox is functioning as intended. PVP gets an occasional look despite reportedly having a dedicated Crucible Strike Team of developers to work on the content, but seemingly are nowhere when major expansions are in development, suggesting that those resources are also required to develop a full expansion (see new 2025+ Destiny 2 Expansion model moving into 2 smaller expansions per fiscal year instead of 1 large annual expansion).\n",

Playing with friends makes it even better, but LFG groups are a solid way to enjoy the high-level stuff too.\n",

      "\n",
      "- Free to try. You'll need to spend money to get current content if you want to keep playing.\n",
      "- New player experience is rough. Once you hit max level, you can do your daily/weekly activities for the season to get better gear. It will almost be a routine when you play. Look up content creators on Youtube if you are lost or have any questions.\n",
      "- PvE (seasonal activities, dungeons, and raids) is great. Seasonal activities get minor updates every season in the current expansion.\n",
      "- PvP is rough. There are cheaters and sweat lords. The meta is often based around 1 shot/ability builds. You'll either love it or hate it.\n",
      "- Content is vaulted and taken out of the game. If you didn't do the content that you paid before they remove it, you lose out.\n",
      "- Vaulted content can come back with updates. To be fair, plenty of games with lots of content (WoW as an example) will update content and call it \"new\".\n",
      "- The game is very grindy. You'll be running you preferred PvP or PvE content over and over to get the best stat drops on armor or best perk drops on weapons.\n",
      "- The lore is really good but it is a lot to get a grip on.\n",
      "\n",
      "-Most importantly, don't play this game 365 days a year. You will get burned out, just like everything else, if you do that. I will play a season or 2 with the new expansion and then take 6 months or more off, depending what else I'm interested in.\n",

      "So the story is a really important game, but it's funny for people who like to see the story.I don't know if you are more curious about the future story even though you have previewed it on YouTube, but the total hand tastes good, but the campaign play time will be about 10 to 20 hours, so it will be really boring for people who don't care about the story.so\n",

But it's not a good game for people who use PvP because of various problems.I like PVP games, but I just want this feeling, then go to the Halo Master Chief Collection.There's no update, but it's fun there.Sometimes it's good to turn on or two.You can feel how well the game was in the heyday.\n",

      "1220/2500 | 76561199615259834 → As an old player who has been in the open beta of \"Destiny 2\", my feelings for this game are very complicated.It once indulged me with its stunning shooting feel and grand worldview, but its operational strategy and content quality in recent years have made people increasingly disappointed.Although the Steam page shows that the positive review rate of nearly 5 million reviews is still 62%, this cannot hide the fact that the game is losing core players.\n",
      "1. The freshness of being overdrawn: content repetition and creativity exhaustion\n",
      "The open world exploration of Destiny 2 should have been the biggest highlight, but with season updates year after year, map design gradually fell into routine.Taking the latest \"Autumn of Light\" DLC as an example, although the neon aesthetics of Ohmna in Neptune's city is eye-catching, it is difficult to conceal the problem of empty maps and repetition of tasks - players are still repeating the cycle of \"clear monsters - open treasure chests - brush equipment\", lacking the puzzle or plot interaction that really makes people shine.What is even more helpless is that Bungie seems to be trapped in the vicious circle of \"refreshing cold rice\": Although the \"Edge of Destiny\" expansion package launched in 2025 promises a new mechanism, the \"Material Spark\" transformation ability and Kepler planet exploration in the trailer have not yet broken out of the traditional framework of \"puzzle + battle\".\n",
      "2. Disputes about the paid model: high-priced DLC and liver-fisting design\n",
      "The game's paid strategy is a \"double-edged sword\".On the one hand, the buyout body + season pass model seems flexible, but the actual experience is full of routines: the \"Year of Prophecy\" bundle in 2025 is priced at up to $100, including two expansion packs and four season passes, while the actual content volume of each DLC is often criticized by players for being \"not worth the ticket price\".For example, \"Autumn of Light\" DLC has received most negative reviews on Steam due to its short and fast plot and perfunctory duplicate design, and even made a joke by players as a \"defense of 29% positive reviews.\"On the other hand, the season pass rewards are not attractive to old players, and Zero Krypton players need to invest hundreds of hours to unlock all content, while the mythical skin special effects of paid unlocking are often criticized as \"not as stunning as the first generation.\"\n",
      "3. The flaws of technology and social interaction: server and matching dilemma\n",
      "The technical problems of \"Destiny 2\" can be regarded as \"stubborn disease\".After the \"Autumn of Light\" was launched in 2023, the Claims system update caused frequent server crashes, and the downtime and maintenance at least once a week made players suffer.Although Bungie promises to introduce a “self-healing” feature in the subsequent 2023 season, latest feedback from 2025 shows that there are still issues with dropouts and matching delays during prime time.Social experience is also worrying: high-difficulty dungeons such as six-person raids require voice communication, but the in-game matching mechanism often forces new and old players to team up, resulting in frequent team destruction of wild teams; in PvP mode, the phenomenon of \"fried fish\" is repeatedly banned, and it is common for novice players to be crushed by master players as soon as they land.\n",
      "4. The only highlights: shooting feel and art skills\n",
      "It is undeniable that the core gameplay of \"Destiny 2\" still has unique charm.Firearm design is an industry benchmark, from the crisp continuous shooting of automatic rifles to the lethal blow of sniper rifles, each weapon has a distinct feel difference; the combination of professional skills is also full of depth, such as the hunter's \"Silk-Binding\" skill and the \"Glorious Dance Machine\" armor combination once dominated the PvP battlefield (although it was subsequently urgently weakened).In terms of art, whether it is Neptune's neon city or the mysterious atmosphere of the pyramid spacecraft, it shows Bungie's top scene construction ability, and the cinematic expression of CG animation is talked about by players all year round.\n",
      "Conclusion: The struggle of old players and the threshold of new players\n",
      "If you are a newcomer who is in contact for the first time, the free content of \"Destiny 2\" can still provide dozens of hours of refreshing experience, especially with Chinese dubbing and Guardian system guidance, the difficulty of getting started has been greatly reduced.But for old players, the sense of repetition and paid pressure of the game are eroding their enthusiasm - when \"retrofits\" have changed from fun to mission, and when the updates of each season repeat the routine of \"new skin + old mechanism\", the former cosmic adventure epic has gradually become \"refreshing brush brush brush brush brush\".If Bungie wants to restore reputation, maybe there should be less \"lightsaber linkage\" gimmicks and more innovations in core gameplay.After all, what players need is not \"old wine in new bottles\", but the real interstellar legend.\n",
      "1221/2500 | doublevendetta → Coming back here as a (visibly) veteran, longtime player, even since the first game on Xbox 360, since I was already in the review writing neighborhood for a different title. This game, and its developer are both in a sorry state. I can't recommend continuing to support this so long as that continues.\n",
      "\n",
      "I migrated to Linux a little under two years ago when I got fed up with Windows' more recent nonsense, after getting a Steam Deck. I have not regretted that decision once, since. Bungie's poor treatment and mass layoff of large swathes of its staff were the first nail in the coffin of my continued financial support of this game or its developer, and their refusal to even significantly INVESTIGATE Steam Deck/Linux compatibility was the nail that set me on the course of ignoring it even as an F2P'er. That stance, and those behaviors, have not changed.\n",
      "\n",
      "I even tried hopping back on via GeForce Now for just a little bit the other day, because I DID feel a bit of panging nostalgia for that satisfying core PvP loop. That was dead inside half an hour after seeing just how many aggressive pop ups were still being thrown in my face asking me to spend money, and then feeling the Jell-O like latency inherent in the way that I had to interact with the game. To those of you who continue to enjoy this game, I wish you no ill will or misfortune, but I do strongly encourage you to maybe put it down for a week or so, and then see if when you come back, you feel the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for me, I certainly do not miss it, and this is very very likely the end of my journey as a Guardian. This is only further cemented and vindicated by the recent situation surrounding and its alleged uncredited theft of artwork.\n",

It has a lot of issues that will not get better by the looks of it, with a lack of meaningful content, horrible new player on-boarding, and the high price to enjoy a hollow shell of the game that could've been, do not bother.\n",

After downloading the game again on Steam and purchasing all the DLC I bought on Xbox, I desperately wanted to give them a chance to prove themselves capable. But no, Edge of Fate is not looking promising and seems that they've learned nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Time gated content and the Seasonal model has not been the best move in my opinion for the health of the game. Having players feel as if they need to play the game or miss out on an ever developing story, activities, weapons, cosmetics etc. because they do not have the time to play or have other games they want to sink time into sucks. Especially the story aspect of the game.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The story of Destiny is incredibly deep and interesting. Too bad so much of it can not be experienced ever again. Unless you want to spend time outside the game to read the story or watch videos of the story and such, you will miss out on so many moments that should be mainstays within a campaign that they ripped away.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. PVP is a complete travesty. I primarily played the PVP portion of the game since PVE tends to bore after sometime. Nothing feels as fluid and dynamic as Destiny 2 PVP. But it has been in such a pathetic state for years, even after promises to divert more attention to the rotting corpse that is crucible. The lack of maps that are well crafted and ones that are well catered to the speed and flow of the game sucks, especially in the higher skill brackets. While the game was never known for balance, time and time again, Bungie would create changes to the game that would create a horrendous meta within PVP. It happens and it wouldn't be an issue if they made changes more swiftly than leaving it for six months. Balance patches that change virtually nothing, or completely destroy the usability of weapons or subclasses, and neglecting other archetypes all together. The PVP in this game was my absolute favorite part and what made me fall in love with the game. Hurts to see how it turned out.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Marathon, the layoffs, the lawsuit, the scandals and Pete Parsons. Bungie has not had it easy for sometime and the community sentiment around them is not good, nor has it been for a while. But it is entirely deserved for middle management and up. They are truly inept and incapable at what they do. Marathon taking away resources from Destiny 2 at a time when it needed a lot of love was a mistake. Pete Parsons car collection growing while the number of employees they can afford dwindles is laughable. The lawsuit involving the Red War campaign is another fire that should've easy for them to put out, but are still fighting. The scandal involving Christopher Barrett as well as the stolen art is unreal.\n",

      "I could ramble on more but its just death by a thousand unnecessary cuts really. Ill always have a soft spot for the franchise, after spending probably over 3000 hours on Destiny 1 and 2, I've had a blast with it, but I don't have any love for the game anymore, just frustration and sadness.\n",

You will pay more than you ever have and you will eventually lose everything you grind for or buy with each expansion. No other game or developer disrespects their player base more than Bungie. The new upcoming \"expansion\" is half the size of previous content. Which isn't saying much because all the content since Forsaken has been confusing and half-assed. Destiny 2 literally died with Cayde-6 (the only enjoyable character the series has ever had). What came after was what Bungie dreamed up for Destiny 3 (but kept the Destiny 2 label) and it's been a ♥♥♥♥-storm ever since. \"Destiny 3\" died with The Final Shape. Whatever comes next is going to be laughable at best. Despite having the best gunplay \"feel\" this game will constantly frustrate and disappoint you. Even with that being said, calling destiny a shooter is kind of a joke at this point. It's entirely focused on abilities now.

      "Destiny 2 is a live-service looter shooter MMO FPS that blends together sci-fi and fantasy genres to create a beautiful world, and a space-magic power fantasy. The premise is that you are a Guardian: a death-defying hero that wields the powers of Light and Darkness to defend humanity and the universe at large. There are 3 classes (Titan, Hunter, and Warlock), each inspired by traditional RPG roles (e.g. Warrior, Ranger, and Mage respectively). Within these classes, there are 6 subclasses; 5 specialize in their own unique element/damage type, while the 6th showcases mastery and flexibility over each of the elements. Each subclass is unique and can be freely switched whenever you wish (1 class per character, however). As you can imagine, this design lends itself well to playing the game in different ways (e.g. weapons-focused, specializing in abilities, close-range vs. long-range, DPS vs. support). In this aspect, I find the game engaging. There are many opportunities for buildcrafting, though I do wish that the meta didn't tend to be so clear-cut (at any given time, there are usually only a handful of builds that dominate the PvE and PvP meta). Each subclass has enough to work with such that it is usable in both solo and team play.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately for some, Destiny 2's grind is also RPG-esque. You are encouraged to run many same-ish activities for more powerful gear, or specific rolls on weapons or armour. Exactly how much of a grind this is can vary; some activities offer craftable weapon patterns, meaning that you are eventually guaranteed an opportunity to just make the roll you want of a particular weapon. Other times, this system doesn't exist and you are doomed to roll the dice time and time again, with no such guarantee that you will get the piece of gear you want. The various campaigns do fall under this umbrella as well; while they provide a bit of novelty, it quickly wears off on repeated playthroughs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The peak of Destiny 2's gameplay is in its raids and dungeon activities; these are multi-encounter activities that test both problem solving skills and your gameplay execution. Raids are typically designed with 4-6 players in mind, while dungeons are balanced around 3-player teams, though you can solo them. The biggest flaw of these activities is its biggest strength; you need other players to team up with to tackle these activities, because there is a specific sort of experience Bungie is going for in their encounter design. In addition, there is a large emphasis on communication. For example, many encounters rely on providing each player with incomplete information and requiring them to communicate with other players to figure out how to proceed. Yet, raids and dungeons do not have matchmaking, though there is an in-game party finder and communities on Discord and elsewhere dedicated to putting raid/dungeon groups together if you are comfortable with talking to people online. Otherwise, you had best hope that you can get some friends together, because these activities are the best that Destiny 2 has to offer. Beautiful locales, engaging mechanics, endgame-worthy loot, and enough of an endurance test to make your clears feel truly rewarding.\n",
      "\n",
      "In case you missed it, Destiny 2, as it is at time of writing, is missing quite a bit of stuff. A lot of content from launch to the Forsaken expansion got vaulted and is no longer accessible. In addition, Destiny 2's live-service model involves multiple paid seasons featuring a handful of activities that you are expected to grind, and plot-relevant story content. Most of this seasonal content, too, gets vaulted when the next expansion releases. For the former, there is no way around it; you just have to be comfortable with not being able to access that older content. For the latter, you need to acknowledge that the seasonal content is not mandatory for you to play. Bungie will try to get you with FOMO; deal with it. If you really want to play the content, at least wait for the last bit of the content to release and see what the reception is before deciding to buy the pass.\n",
      "\n",
      "I like this game. Truly, I do. But there is zero respect for your time and money. When the game peaks, it's awesome. Moments like getting my first raid clears with my friends are special to me. These peaks are why I am even recommending this game. Just, please, have some respect for yourself and recognize when you're playing against your will.\n",
      "1377/2500 | mochimitsu7 → It is truly baffling how a game once heralded as the future of online shooters has devolved into a prime example of how not to design a live-service title. Destiny 2 is not simply disappointing: it is actively hostile to players’ time, intelligence, and expectations.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's no real reward for long-term commitment, no innovation in mission design, and certainly no sense of satisfaction. What remains is a loop engineered not for fun, but for compulsion. Rather than respecting players’ time, Destiny 2 excels at wasting it. Hours can be poured into the game with nothing meaningful to show for it. The reward systems are pathetic. It rivals the worst of Korean MMORPGs, and that's not a good thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "New players are, to put it bluntly, thrown into the deep end without a map, compass, or even the faintest hint of what’s going on. There is no campaign to introduce tone, mechanics, or story. Systems are layered upon systems with no tutorialization, no coherence, and no onboarding. The impression is clear: newcomers are not welcome, nor are they considered. It's as if Bungie has actively designed the experience to repel anyone who isn't already deeply into it.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a direct consequence, the narrative is an incomprehensible disaster. Characters appear with no introduction, events unfold with no context, and entire story arcs are missing—literally. Bungie has chosen to remove previous campaigns, which means players cannot experience crucial narrative moments. The lore is simply delivered via cryptic text, inaccessible missions, and seasonal cutscenes that vanish after a few weeks. It is not just bad storytelling, it is storytelling withheld. Do you want to know more? Go to Youtube to waste even more time watching 40+ minutes-long videos of gibberish and nonsensical plots, which open more questions than answering them.\n",
      "\n",
      "But perhaps the most unforgivable offense is the removal of paid content. Bungie has taken the deeply anti-consumer step of vaulting expansions and campaigns that players paid for. If you took a break (as any NORMAL adult with a job, family, or other interests might), you're punished. Missions are gone. Gear is obsolete. Activities are locked. The game demands total devotion and punishes anything less. This is not a game for people with lives: it’s a time sink with an expiration date.\n",
      "\n",
      "And beyond that, each season brings the same structure—a few new weapons, a gimmicky activity, and more grinding. There has not been a meaningful systemic update since at least 2019. Dungeon and raid mechanics, often lauded as clever, quickly reveal themselves to be unintuitive and frustrating, especially when combined with arbitrary modifiers and punishing design. There is a feeling that the development is stuck on autopilot, recycling ideas with less and less polish.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is not a recommendation; it is a warning. Destiny 2 is a game that rewards obsession and punishes moderation. It is not for newcomers, not for shooter fans, not for lore nerds, and certainly not for anyone looking for a fulfilling or respectful use of their time. The only people who might enjoy Destiny 2 are those with infinite free hours and no concern for narrative, progress, or coherence. And even then, I pity them.\n",

      "Now game modes are all just a slap to the face Strikes (PVE) is just doing old missions from the story with a slight change like different enemies and a midpoint boss But there is also Nightfalls in this same catagory that is just strikes but \"harder\" aka making everyone bullet sponges.\n",
      "Well the second gamemode is Crucible (PVP) its player vs player its fine IF You have the current god roll weapon otherwise you will just be killed by someone who is using the god roll of the week. A sub mode of this is Trials of Osris this is the so called Compettive mode and is normally infested with cheaters and in order to get anything good from Trials you must win 7 Times in a row with no failure, It is awful.\n",
      "And the last main mode is Gambit (PVPVE) 2 teams of 4 must kill enemies on their own map and bank motes dropped form said enemies and at 25 banked motes you can \"invade\" the other teams map and try to kill them destroying all motes they have with most invades going you pick up a heavy weapon and blast all 4 of the enemy team before they see you and they lose all momentum they had, Or you get shot instantly by their heavy weapon being sent back with noting to show. Well after 100 banked mote by you team you get a \"Boss\" that goes one of two ways 1 you instantly blow the boss up and win or 2 you shoot at it and it becomes unkillable until you kill a miniboss and then you can attack the main boss again and do it two more times to win. This mode is pretty much dead no one likes playing this mode as 90% of the time one team ends up stomping the other to the ground with no chance of recovery due to the invasions and with one team not being properly equipped with the current God Rolls. Bungie has said they have stopped working on gambit entirely they have said so in one of the Edge of fate blog posts (TWID 06/12/2025 if you want the source).\n",
      "I used to love this game and Bungie. But it is a shell of what it once was, Between complete Neglect of D2 and their new game Marathon (and all the issues with that and their art fiasco) I can only hope that Bungie turns around and fixes everything.. But i know better at this point, It will never happen they will never bother to fix it and only keep beating this dead horse of a game till its nothing but dust trying to get every penny from people too deep in their sunk-cost fallacy.\n",
      "1529/2500 | 76561199877894398 → I have played over 5000 hours of destiny 2 of multiple platforms Ps4/5 and xbox one, the game his simultaneously the best, most satisfying gameplay, whilst also achieving the absolute worst and most soul destroying gameplay loop. Each expansion is either one of the best pieces of media you could consume with a well defined vision and passion portrayed through intricate, interesting and imaginative story telling through in-game cutscenes, lore tabs on weapons and armour and environmental story telling via dungeons, raids, etc. for example Forsaken, Beyond Light and The Witch Queen -OR- there's the other side of the coin where the story is a mix of plot holes, bland drivel, pointless endeavours and moments that we have waited years for that when they arrive are severely mishandled; Gameplay is void of any life from prior expansions, padded with trickles of lore to lead the player through a completely thrown together narrative and needless downtime. examples, Shadowkeep, Lightfall and Basegame D2, Curse of Osiris and less so Warmind, The latter 3 (which was paid and not free to play just like all other expansions) arent even in the game anymore (lol, but not really rip your money you poor soul) i am no English major, i am not a Game Dev i am a mere consumer/recovering D2 addict. This game used to have a grip on me like a Goth Dominatrix on a beta cucks measly locked up scrotum. i both love this game with every fibre of my weeny, yet also despise this game with every anal fluid from my loose floppy rectum after bungo is done using my wallet funds as lubrication to rearrange my little twink innards like they're playing an Unpacking speed run ( unpacking is a very good game btw very chill you rearrange various rooms with items while living a lovely lesbian fantasy and as a male what more could you want ) NOW as i write this i can't stress enough that destiny 2 is by definition a \"Good\" game although not without its moments of darkness (nice pun) but its my moral compass that prevents me from recommending this game to a single living being on this planet as i would be responsible for the absolute cosmic dread that this game plunges your mental state into. if you have never played this game, please stay as far away from this steam page as possible unless your life genuinely could not get any worse. if you have played this game and cant stop, please your family misses who you used to be, how you used to laugh, that sparkle in your eye that wasn't plagued by a vacant glossy husk emanating from within your very being, you are loved by many people please go outside and hug someone, anyone with prior consent. If you're thinking of returning to this game. Don't. sorry this is long my therapist recommended writing a letter to my ex's, but i decided id write my ex a steam review. I'm off to finish healing, i wish you would too, you deserve better than your gas-lighting, abusive and neglectful ex girl/boyfriend Destiny 2 and in extension Bungie.\n",

Then I ask you, I slow down the speed dizziness overload, what is the use of triggering broken ice during the control-free period after the overload Warrior's stun ends?The entire ice branch can only faint one warrior now, don’t you think it’s a joke?How do you let the native pure ice branches live?Then this season's activities are all replicas of old things. The reward for the event content is the promotion. The endless brushing of the book is the promotion. What kind of black slave am I? I asked me to repeatedly brush those who have played hundreds of times for a little bit of light, etc. The key is that you still have the upper limit for entering the book. If you raise the full amount, you will go to jail or go to jail.Then there is damage adjustment.I am a slutty horse, I play a pve game. I will definitely feel good when I see big numbers. I used to watch tens of thousands or tens of thousands of dollars and I am unhappy when I see someone who is not happy. If I go down to see someone who is uncomfortable, you can change it to 200, and 300 dollars for me, I feel like I laughing.Then this Kepler plot is also based on it. After playing for a long time, I don’t know what core gameplay is to turn into a small ball and a shell to watch it. I still find it interesting if you let me decrypt the local map and play it for one or two games. If you let me do this in the main line, I just feel disgusting. The pure mechanism is applied, and it is not easy to play, and the operation is cumbersome.This ball becomes smaller is also a god. First of all, you will still deduct blood when you become smaller, and you will become disabled when you are crippled. Then every time you become smaller, you will be dizzy and your eyes are shaking. There are also many mechanisms and monsters that force you to use the ball to electric shock. This electric shock has a backswing, and the damage is still low.There are also those two new monsters. Isn’t the Flying Soldier the Fallen Feller the Fallen Feller the Fallen Feller the Fallen Feller the Fallen Feller the Fallen Feller the Fallen Feller the Fallen Feller, oh, and that B-Bin Silk Soldier. The Fallen Feller the Fallen Feller has at least a long back shake + straight line defect. Although it is disgusting to be hit, it is still a skill that balances risks and benefits. However, your Silk Soldier of the Year 8 will start soon and rebound. Once you hang up, you will lose your people. It is pure and disgusting players.The experience I gave me throughout the 8th year is not as good as the worst and worst unjust soul season in 7th year. Now I feel inexplicably irritated every time I go online. The scene of the update of Vientiane when the 7th year is still vivid in my mind. In a blink of an eye, I became a world of sorrow. I never thought that my feelings for the same game would have such a huge reversal in just one year. SB Bang Chicken should be destroyed with the marathon as soon as possible.\n",

And matches are unbalanced because of either cheaters or streamers that 6 stack and pubstomp lobbies resulting in people leaving games and making matches even worse. This game is not solo friendly, most activities require other players. Bungie sacrificed this game for the flop Marathon called and it shows. Was a good game until the ceo decided that firing people and buying cars was more important. This game sucks now and I wouldn't recommend this to my worst enemy.\n",

It went through a substantial change to some of its core systems, but overall the Destiny experience of the past few years (both good and bad) is still here. In that vein, this xpac is worth its $40 price tag, especially if you are a new player or love destiny lore. There will be plenty to chew on there. For the more hardcore player, the biggest weakness of the xpac will present itself at the endgame where the pseudo infinite light level grind gets tedious and repetitive very quickly. The new world tiers system, while an interesting concept, isn't a sufficient replacement for a new activity. At the time of writing this review, the raid hasn't come out yet so it's possible it manages to flesh out the endgame even more, but only time will tell. While the scope of the new xpac is definitely smaller than in the past, the new cadence of content drops may offset this. As it stands, this is a fairly strong foundation for the new Destiny saga but Bungie will need to drastically rethink the endgame as well as its gameplay loop in order to justify players' time.\n",

      "1760/2500 | 76561198144113084 → Bangs, of course, well done, I love their game, I can still understand the Grind of a new stuffy, but they must do something with their policy about the new equipment, they can give buns to new equipment, but why force people to use:\n",
      "1) the new armor, which is given by the DAY resistance and different sets, which is cool, but that you cannot physically reveal the scatter of the stats that you want for the build, choose from 6 options from 2 stages of the main and additional and on random you will receive a pinch of 3 as a gift, but they do not cover all the combinations of the stats that you may need to be required\n",

      "\n",
      "Conclusion: the game is excellent, but so far this season I would not advise playing until the banks correct the key problems that they themselves created under the sauce \"New content that they are ganging.\"They greatly limited the building, and this is the beam on which the game holds.Yes, they added many funny combinations, but I want to play not only what the banks said, but I want to do something of my own.\n",

      "* Lots of difficult content available for hardcore/endgame players.\n",

      "\n",
      "Cons:\n",
      "* VERY EXPENSIVE TO GET INTO. This may change in the future, but you currently need to spend about $150 for the bundle of all DLCs (this bundle still doesn't include some of the dungeon keys, which are another $20 each), some of which are pretty much required to craft meta builds or play the most enjoyable content. Do not let the \"free to play\" tag fool you. There is a lot you can do without buying DLCs, but you will be missing out on a ton of content.\n",
      "\n",
      "* A ton of content from past expansions has been removed from the game, making a lot of loot very hard to farm (if you even can), and has caused the story line to become a jumbled mess. There is a timeline that gives a brief explanation of the story line, as well as some playable missions to explain large parts of the story, but it is still very confusing to new and old players. I would advise watching a video explaining the story to understand how we got to where we are.\n",
      "\n",
      "* If you do not own all the DLCs, the game will barrage you with \"ads\" to try to get you to purchase the content.\n",
      "\n",
      "* New player experience is awful, and the game pretty much expects you to have a friend to help you understand what to do. I would highly recommend a guide, as it can feel very overwhelming when you are given quests from 8 different expansions at the same time. The game also forces you into the first mission of the most recent campaign/seasonal content when re launching the game, which only causes even more confusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Exotics no longer feel \"exotic\", as they are much more common then they used to be. Others may see this as a good thing, and it does help new players catch up, but I don't get a rush of excitement when I get an exotic anymore which is what they are supposed to make you feel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conclusion:\n",
      "I would suggest trying the game before purchasing any expansions, and I would only get the expansions on sale as most are not worth the current price. The $150 bundle does go on sale occasionally (currently $23 right now for the usually $150 light and darkness collection). If you are looking to get into the game and don't want to wait for a sale, I would say the most important DLCs in order are:\n",
      "1. The final shape (unlocks the prismatic subclass, has a great campaign, some pretty good exotics, salvation's edge raid, and some new supers for prismatic/other subclasses)\n",
      "2. Lightfall (unlocks strand subclass, good exotics, root of nightmares raid, mid campaign)\n",
      "3. Forsaken pack (unlocks 20 exotics as well as letting you choose 3 for free, last wish raid, campaign is no longer in the game)\n",
      "4. Witch queen (cool exotics, vow of the disciple raid, fantastic campaign)\n",

If you don't use the Portal screen, the destinations world—a trademark of the game—is entirely gray… almost symbolizing the current state of the game. Not to mention the raid’s Contest Mode, where even the most efficient, prepared teams I know couldn't finish it on day one. You’re forced to swap loadouts to get perfect DPS, otherwise wipe. And the bosses and environments are flat—so far only the final boss feels “original.” As always, I hope for improvements in future updates, but this time I fear Bungie won't come out of it well.

Extremely patient and guided us throughout the entire raid. Explained every encounter well and showed us were all the secret chests are. Again, helped us with the platforming and looked back to check on us as he guided us through out the entire raid. During the final boss my internet disconnected and the raid was completed by the time I joined back. Was devastated at the time. Then the group told me not to worry and decided to redo the Calus boss fight final encounter on the hardest difficulty just so I can get the rewards. The amount of satisfaction I've got when we all defeated the boss was unmatched. Then he invited me to his clan and taught me how to do multiple raids. Easily the best moment I've had in gaming. All of us working together to complete these challenging puzzles. Say what you will about this game, but it's moments like these that makes this game special.\n",

My favorite game mode is pvp and it is unplayable, especially in control and the 6v6 game modes. The matchmaking is unbalanced with either you stomping the enemy team or you getting stomped. Every game is filled with players teleporting and skipping around making the game not fun to play. Maybe the game should focus on connection quality and team balance instead of sbmm. Being a shotgun and handcanon enjoyer the weapon meta and special system is down right terrible. The new ui is even more confusing than it used to be. Being a returning player with more than 5000 hours in the game I had a hard time knowing where to go, what to do, and what order to do it in. I had to ask my friend and look on youtube to know how to progress. If I was a new player to the game this alone would make me want to quit. The campaign is slow with a bad story and the new mechanic is down right terrible. Looking at the new raid on youtube I am not compelled to even attempt it. Do yourself a favor and stay clear of the game till bungie wakes up and starts making meaningful changes to the game. They might consider over delivering on the next expansion or the game could be cooked for good. And please bungie prioritize making the crucible fun to play instead of ignoring it. It's a shame because I used to play the game for hours on end and wish destiny would return to form.\n",

It used to be the somewhat nerdy, but fun sci-fi shooter you would play with your friends, and enjoy the amazing world building, lore, weapons, exotics, and all of the amazing ins and outs of sol. Contrasted to now, where I had to have the perfect build and immaculate knowledge of a certain vault of glass to even be allowed to speak, or play in the way a developer intended. I am not blaming the community whatsoever, but the constant and undying need for power creep, feature creep, and monetization. They had an amazing franchise that I grew up on for almost 7 years on and off, but they are beating the dust out of a pile of horse bones. The final shape being a climax to the ENTIRE story was executed well enough that I didn't mind waiting the already 10 years since the beginning of the series. I was patient with what the developers had in mind, and patience was needed. It should not under any circumstances have continued the way it did. They reset the power leveling system yet again, to try and fix the non issue that everyone could easily reach the pinnacle with the emissary. They changed the map UI making it easier to push the newest DLC as soon as I reopen the game. They gave my gear different stats than it had, making my build (resilience Titan) utterly useless because of the differently calculated stats. But worst of all? The most heinous act I could imagine in Bungie's decade of this games life? They tried to imitate the Destiny 1 UI and overall look, in nostalgia bait. Classic Destiny 1 died with the battle pass, and it cannot be revived with any amount of stolen cash or matte background Bungie has. What needs to happen now is like letting an old dog die. I would be devastated if Bungie just ol' Yellered the game, but at the same time I feel that the finale gave the game a peaceful end. This sadly wont happen. We all know that Bungie will continue to try writing story arc after story arc, until the people stop paying the penny pinching piper. I would employ a rallying call to stop buying these lack luster expansions, and instead getting upcoming and valuable indie games, but I am just a reviewer whose words fall on deaf ears, like so many disappointed loyalists. Buy if you must, but ye have been warned of the faults founded and unfounded in a game, long dead, with no ghost, no light, and no longevity to carry it through the harsh seasons. I hope that one day before its too late, someone would hear these words, and leave this game to rest peacefully in its grave. Bungie can always start anew, but they could never recreate their joyous past.\n",

      "I was a veteran player of Destiny 1 on Xbox 360 with over 4,000 hours of gameplay. I remember how beautiful it was to explore Venus, the Moon, Earth, Mars, or the Reef, collecting materials, fighting in the Crucible, doing Vanguard strikes, or walking through the old Tower. I also remember fondly the effort it took to get my Possessed armor set, the nerves on my first raid, \"The Vault of Glass,\" and the thrill of defeating the King of the Taken, Oryx, in \"The Taken King.\" Unfortunately, those times will never return, but the memories and stories will remain forever in my mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Destiny 2 was released, I couldn’t play it until it changed to \"New Light\" because I didn’t have the money (something I liked since it was free, but I still felt bad for those who bought it). At that time, I thought the base story + 2 DLCs were great. Ghaul was a fantastic enemy, and although I didn’t like the new Tower at first, I understood that it was a necessary change (along with others they made).\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, it’s sad to see everything that’s been lost. Bungie took away the campaigns we paid for, they took away the planets and areas we knew like the back of our hand, changed the power system over and over again (which frankly is horrible), took our money, and worst of all, they took away a story rich in emotions, action, and friendship.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s true that on a large scale, the story isn’t bad. Cayde-6's death was impactful, the revenge was satisfying, and discovering there was an even greater evil was incredible. But was it really necessary to sell seasons and include DLCs that add nothing? The answer is NO. Destiny 1 also had DLCs full of content, and there was never a need for seasons or launching a DLC every so often. This last part shows how little love the developers have for the game because every time I log in, I see the message: \"Due to time, the voices couldn’t be recorded, so subtitles will appear,\" which translates to: \"Sorry, we couldn’t record the voices in time because we’re eager to get as much of your money as possible, thanks and you’re welcome\".\n",

      "Money is the only thing driving the company, and if you don’t play every day, you’ll fall behind. The pace is so fast that it doesn’t give you time to appreciate what’s around you, like in Destiny 1. And just when you think you’ve finally reached the peak of your character, Bungie releases another season or DLC, and once again, you have to farm, farm, and farm; an endless cycle that eventually tires and saturates the average player.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would love for Destiny 2 to go back to its roots, but I know that will never happen. I just hope that for Destiny 3 (if it ever comes), the developers understand their current mistakes and start selling emotions again, not seasons or DLCs without REAL content.\n",

I miss getting lost in some intricate cavern or city and accidentally activating a secret quest or mission because I just so happened to kill certain enemies in the correct order. You could spend hours learning the lore behind planets and characters. Is the story more streamlined now? Yeah, but not for the better. It's become so shallow. I really don't know what happened at Bungie, and I really miss the story-rich depth this series once had. Once you're done with the story, there's no more exploration, no reward or reason to go off the beaten path. You could go for the Divinity Trace Rifle in the Garden of Salvation Raid to get a feeling of what I'm talking about. That depth was all over the place. I feel like that's the only place where it's left. Now it's just grinding recycled activities with different dialogue to match the context of whatever mission you're doing. It's downright tragic compared to what it once was.\n",

First started back when it was on BNet during Season of Opulence and I had my entire friend group raiding pretty much everyday for shizz and giggles we didn't even care about the loot we just wanted to play the game, but that time is gone. Bungie itself has burned too many of my friends with false promises and content removals for them to keep playing, and the game itself feels like an old tumor-ridden dog just waiting to die, but it won't. It keeps getting second wind after second wind only for it to cough up the same bloody, phlegm-filled promises over and over and over again with no chance of ever delivering. At this point I don't care what flavor of cancer is killing Destiny, either insanely out of touch leadership, equally incompetent developers, it's new owners seeking to extract every ounce of non-infected blood from the proverbial stone, or it's unwillingness to to let anyone who hasn't kept up with it's every thought for 5+ plus years even get close to it. Whatever it is it's terminal and I'm just here to see my dear old Destiny off after 5 years of ups and downs together, even if you have bitten my hand about 5 times, pissed on the carpet, and destroyed my couch; I still love you, but its almost time for you to go into the pearly gates and i'm gonna be there every step of the way.\n",
      "1958/2500 | whitelightcloud → Destiny 2 offers a lot for new players. There’s plenty to do, and the core gameplay especially the gunplay, is excellent. Earning exotics, building your character, and chasing weapons is one of the most rewarding parts of the game. Co-op content like raids and dungeons is well-designed and engaging. The story has improved over the years, and the overall visuals, audio, world-building is consistently high quality. It's a unique game that no other game has matched yet.\n",

      "The user interface is cluttered and not friendly to new players. There are too many systems and vendors with little explanation. Choosing a class doesn’t show you enough about how it plays.

The game removes the tutorial elements quickly and expects players to catch up on their own.\n",

      "\n",
      "I believe it was when the game swapped over to the free to play model they ruined a lot of the game. I can forgive all the visual armor and sparrow microtransactions cause they aren't needed to play nor do they effect gameplay and just help to keep a live service game running long term, but Insanely high priced DLCs and expansions that if you don't own make it feel like you're playing an early access with a bunch of locked content is pretty unforgivable.\n",

(I played a lot on Xbox which is why my hours aren't too high) There honestly were so many aspects of the game that have been altered, such as the gear or light score being completely reworked making old gear simply an aesthetic piece, replacing the old opening of being thrown from the ship with the opening to Destiny 1? really weird choice and so out of place. There was so much of this that I think they should've just made Destiny 3 at this point.\n",

The main reason I'm putting a thumbs down is because I cannot in good faith recommend this game to people who are new to the game and don't have the patience to fully invest in a game like this. The dlc is kinda hit or miss for me, Lightfall being an absolute chore to go through that Bungie even knew this and added the option to PAY to finish the dlc on another play-through. But for whatever reason, at the end of the day I still find myself playing for hours on end. It's a pile of garbage, but at least it's my garbage.\n",

We are not allowed to play any of the previous stories again, whether it be for nostalgia, fun, or to simply complete sitting uncompleted quests... It's truly annoying that Bungie forces us to keep moving forward, yet every time there is an update, the game take tens steps backwards.\n",

They won't help you with any issues and only say you're SOL, there is no way to contact them except through forums, and they removed cross save unlinking for no reason. Now, all my characters and progress I spent hundreds of hours (or thousands) are tied to an old and inactive steam account I can't access and I can't actually resolve this issue because you can't get any support.

Bungie has confirmed they’ll fix this and give us the correct regen they stated\n",

      "\n",
      "🎮 The playability is not fluid.It is not accurate.It is transcendental.Weapons not only shoot - sing.The outbreak of a hand cannon is pure poetry.The planning of a sorcerer (Warlock) is elegance in motion.Whether you are disintegrating the hive with solar grenades or ramming guardians off guard in melting, each action feels designed by gods of the gameplay.\n",

The game struggles to communicate what is going on to a new player and without outside research it would be all too easy to become disinterested and bored playing through the content provided for free.

      "I hate that throughout all these years, whenever I came back to this game I had to watch an absolutely unrelated cinematic that explains basically nothing, and I get to watch multiple loading screens before being thrown into an instance. That is no way to treat a returning player, and that happened every single time I've returned to this game, and a player shouldn't need to skim through a plethora of happenings before jumping back into a game after a certain amount of time. I'm not that invested, but I like the core gameplay - so I should be simply going in, do things that I like, and go out. But that's not a case for a returning player. This has been even worse for newplayers, as they were bombarded with cutscene after cutscene every single time they logged in. How is this not thought by professional people is beyond me. Simply awful experience.\n",

      "The amount of quests, episodes, campaigns, acts, whatever is insane. Especially for a returning player. I look at my quests page, and all I see is things that I have no idea about. There are even quests from content that are no longer available in game, and there is no clear structure which helps the player to understand what's going on with any of these quests. Therefore, you can get extremely overwhelmed by pretty much everything. But one thing that somewhat fixes this is Timeline feature. This is by far the best quality of life change this game has ever had. Timeline helps players to catch up with the important parts of the story. Mind you, this doesn't set you in a timeline of sorts, not even in a fake way like World of Warcraft does, it only enables you to experience very important points in the game's history. Is that enough? I have no idea, the content isn't available. The fact that content isn't available is enough to dislike how content is handled in this game. However, Timeline feature salvages this. The only problem is you probably won't know about it unless you deliberately go around the Destinations page. I think it needs to be better laid out.\n",

The devs have screwed this game probably beyond repair, taking content I've payed for, constantly changing things because they \"don't work\", and making grinding pointless of which makes thousands of hours and hundreds of dollars pointless we all hang on hoping that the game we loved would finally come back but it's gone.

Graphics are fine and gameplay awesome. Put a fantastic soundtrack in there and you can easily get lost for hours and hours. I am relatively new to this game.

If I wanted to play Nathan Drake and climb walls, I'd play uncharted. The game also often crashes. After spending quite a few hours, I still have no clue what is going on with \"the story\".

Come on yeah a few bucks then and their and you have a game with infinite possibilities from guardian class to pick and their abilities. not forgetting the weapons and the perks that come with them. playing with friends is a blast and going through the campaign missions where unforgettable. Yes Bungie has its true game behind a pay wall because its a free game but put your money into it and play the d@mn game its still one hell of a game to play around. Honest rating, great game fun campaign and raids but has bugs time to time and content blocked by a pay wall (7/10)\n",
