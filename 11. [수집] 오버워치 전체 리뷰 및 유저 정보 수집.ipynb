      "186/12571 | 76561198966893480 → I think right now Overwatch 2 is getting slightly better every single season. This game has always been nostalgic and always will have a special place in my heart. On this review you will see that I have only played 42 hours. It's because I play the game on battlenet now. However, I will be umbiased and be completely honest about the game over the past view years.\n",
      "\n",
      "The game status at the moment is horrible. The game is getting ruined by the amount of in-game purchases within this game. Ever once in a while there would be an event or collab, and the only thing free-to-play players would get is a guncharm and some voicelines people probably won't use either. At the end it is their decision to make. But if you want to entertain and humble your audience, you have to make the game interesting. Overwatch during the years had nothing to deliver. And the only time they do is when Marvel Rivals start to get population as Marvel Rivals seem to do care about their audience. But not only Marvel Rivals. Think about Hoyoverse games as well. That is why they're succesful at. It pains me that Overwatch failed to deliver it as a game.\n",
      "\n",
      "If I had to prefer Overwatch as a purchasable game vs Overwatch being Free-to-play, I would honestly pick the first option. I think the game developers would be more dedicated to put a game as a sale instead of money laundring with in-game cosmetics. Some characters (*Cough cough, Kiriko*) have 4 event/premium skins in a row. This is absolutely ridiculous.\n",

      "The current state with Stadium being added, Freya, soon (By this time) Wuyang. Overwatch seems to perform better. But I do hope they do not stop here.

      "Speaking about community: This community is horrid. And no, this does not mean that everyone playing this game is horrible. But you, the reader probably have an Idea who I am targeting. The bad people in this game also ruins the experience. It ruined not only mine, but many of my other friends as well. Even in casual sometimes people take it way to seriosuly. But never as much as Marvel Rivals and that is what makes this game somewhat better than Marvel Rivals. I think this game deserves a community like Team Fortress 2. But we know that Team Fortress 2 has the best fan base ever (biased).\n",

I invested about 2k hours or even more in this game.But suddenly everything was over from now on.Supposedly cheats or hacks were supposedly tracked.Sure everyone says that of course he never hacked, but in my case it really didn't make any sense.Overwatch was pretty much the only game for several years that I played alongside League of Legends.In addition, I spent around 450 € for loot boxes over the years.For this reason alone, it would be very stupid to jeopardize his account.I have dealt with Blizzard Support for 2 years, but never could achieve anything.If I got an answer from a real employee at all, they were still not very helpful.It was only said that there were evidence of my violations and nothing more.Even after I have ever listed all of the transactions made, mostly only machine -written answers came back.Fraud!!!!!A shame, because Overwatch was actually a good game.Unfortunately, that doesn't work at all.Thank God there are now Marvel Rivals.Rights are the more popular game.So do you a favor and just play Marvel Rivals.If you want to play overwatch, at least don't spend any money.If you are unlucky, your account ends like mine.\n",

Tons of people that don't know what theyre doing, and it can have the tendency of being toxic, but you roll with the punches and have fun with it. Also, this is a cross platform game. A lot of ppl scream bots, but the reality of it is that there are a lot of players using a controller, and either don't use M&K or don't have one for their system. I've never once had the feeling of someone being a bot, just that some may have zero idea what theyre doing, or even smaller kids that don't understand the game.

      "Overwatch 1 was caught in the crossfire during the loot-box controversy, it was the most rewarding of the said mechanic and encourages playing the game. Sure we see a lot of 'Loot box opening' videos, but you can literally earn the skin within a month. A limited legendary skin would cost 1000 credits -or get lucky in the loot box. For every legendary duplicates you get 200 credits, not enough? You get 5 credits per common duplicates, 15 for rare, and 50 for epic. You get 4 items per lootbox, earn 3 lootboxes in 9 wins a week, get 1 when you level up, get 1 when you try a limited time gamemode for the first time. The skins are to come back every associated season and during Overwatch Anniversary. Now, Overwatch 2 is a sequel about collecting skins, almost comparable to NFT games.\n",

      "Personally, I've never understood the hate on \"Goats\", I played my fair share on comp and only ever done it once and it was crazy fun. Most of my memorable games involved non-meta lineups such as a torb, sym, zarya, bastion, mercy and lucio. The moment role queue was implemented I was stuck either tank or healer, mostly tank, which got worse when 6v6 was replaced to 5v5.\n",

So why is it that instead on building the world and story, we keep getting collabs? A collab maybe once a quarter is fun, but did we really need another K/DA? Furthermore, do we really need that many Widow, Mercy and Kiriko skin? At this point it feels more like the devs are playing Barbie with the cutest characters.\n",

I add my phone number and go to do the Captcha, I do it once and don't get it wrong, green tick and all, but wait... It gives me an error. So it thinks i'm some robot with a phone number who just slaved away on the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Captcha that takes a decade to do. So i try again, this time on the audio one. And get a green tick again, i'm full of joy because surely a green tick means i'm a human. No according to Overwatch 2 i'm a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ robot. On what planet am i a piece of scrap metal who is trying to play a video game, especially this piece of Junk that deserves to be wiped off the planet.

I don't understand why this game is doing this. Can it be connected to the NetEase account? If it cannot be, it can be connected to the gods and demons. It's really against the will. I heard from my friends about Blizzard SB. I didn't expect it to be so SB. From now on, I won't be optimistic about Blizzard. It's better to close SB Blizzard as soon as possible. The attitude towards players is the same as the little fairies now. They both want and make money and show off, and they are both good at making money and being both good at it.

Runs very well too. Secondary criticisms include cosmetic variety, and hell, cosmetic systems being bad in general, and the sacking of animators leading to, you guessed it, no animated cinematics. Also Freja is a bland and boring character.\n",

Blizzard saw how other companies were making major profits from their games: free to play with battles passes, and they even locked some characters behind the battle pass at one point. They deleted the old game and forced everybody to play this one instead. Hyping up their new 5 v 5 mode and re balancing every character in the game to match their vision. A big chunk of the player base didn't like this and stopped playing. Then, they catered to the fan base that stayed and it really just made the game worse. The tanks and healers get buffed: the healers focus on offense more than heals. The tank is a better DPS. Changing the game in this way completely took away roles and teamwork when you weren't playing with a sweaty group of friends, and it made mismatches in skill feel much more frustrating and harder to overcome. I think that this game is only really still around because it's free for kids and the nostalgia for its predecessor. This game does not bring joy to play. The only reason that I have 30+ hours is because my little brother wants to play it with me like we used to. 4/10\n",

      "2709/12571 | 76561198013829603 → Overwatch 2 has had quite a turbulent journey, but I have to admit—it’s in a much better place now than it was at launch. One of the standout improvements is the shift to 5v5 gameplay. At first, I was skeptical, but it’s actually turned out to be a great change. The smaller team size improves overall clarity and makes individual impact feel more meaningful, especially for the tank role, which now feels central to the flow of the match. Tanks finally have the spotlight they deserve, and team coordination seems more focused as a result.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another highlight is the new perk system. It's a fun and refreshing addition that brings a bit more strategy and variety to matches. Whether you're playing casually or competitively, the perks introduce new ways to approach familiar heroes and situations, which helps keep things from getting stale.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also appreciate the return of the classic 6v6 mode. While I don't play it as often myself, having the option available is a nice nod to longtime players who miss the original format. It shows Blizzard is at least listening to part of the community and trying to bridge the gap between old and new.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, it's impossible to ignore the missteps. Blizzard made a major promise with the idea of a rich single-player PvE experience, only to walk it back later. That move understandably frustrated a lot of fans, and added to the feeling that Overwatch 2 was becoming more of a monetization platform than a true sequel. For a while, it really did feel like the game was veering into “cash grab” territory.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, credit where it's due—Blizzard seems to be steering things in the right direction again. Recent updates show more attention to balance, content quality, and player feedback. While there’s still room for improvement, the fun is genuinely back, and I find myself enjoying the game again in a way I haven’t for a while.\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all, Overwatch 2 is far from perfect, but it’s evolving in the right direction. The core gameplay is still incredibly satisfying, and with the right focus, the game could fully reclaim its former glory. Worth giving it another shot if you’ve been on the fence.\n",

      "2728/12571 | 76561199810036214 → MTN DEW and Doritos: A Legendary Snack Duo\n",
      "\n",
      "When it comes to snacking in modern pop culture, few pairings are as iconic as MTN DEW and Doritos. Over the years, this soda-and-chip combo has transcended the shelves of convenience stores and vending machines to become a symbol of gaming culture, late-night snacking, and bold, unapologetic flavor. This essay explores the history, cultural impact, and marketing genius behind these two products and how they came to dominate the snack world together.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Origins\n",
      "Mountain Dew, originally created in the 1940s, began as a citrus-flavored mixer for whiskey. Over time, it evolved into the bright green, highly caffeinated soda we know today, especially after PepsiCo acquired the brand in 1964. Its high sugar content and intense flavor helped it gain popularity, particularly among younger consumers seeking a sweet energy boost.\n",
      "\n",
      "Doritos, on the other hand, debuted in 1966. Frito-Lay introduced them as the first nationally marketed tortilla chips in the U.S. Their crunchy texture and wide variety of bold flavors—especially Nacho Cheese and Cool Ranch—made them a hit from the start.\n",
      "\n",
      "A Match Made in Marketing Heaven\n",
      "The real magic happened when MTN DEW and Doritos became linked in advertising and gamer culture in the early 2000s. Both brands targeted a similar demographic: young, thrill-seeking consumers—especially teenagers and gamers. With high-octane branding, neon colors, and marketing campaigns full of energy and attitude, they became staples of late-night gaming sessions and sleepovers.\n",
      "\n",
      "PepsiCo, which owns both brands, smartly leveraged this overlap. They ran cross-promotional campaigns, including special gaming-themed packaging, limited edition flavors like “MTN DEW Game Fuel,” and exclusive content unlocked by purchasing both products. In doing so, they created not just snacks, but a shared experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gamer Culture and Memes\n",
      "In the internet age, MTN DEW and Doritos have taken on a life of their own. They became the stereotypical snacks of choice for hardcore gamers, often featured in memes and satirical content online. Phrases like “MLG” (Major League Gaming) and “420 blaze it” memes often feature the glowing green Dew and a bag of Doritos, usually paired with over-the-top graphics, dubstep music, and gaming headsets.\n",
      "\n",
      "This memeification, while humorous, only increased brand recognition. Rather than reject or fight this portrayal, both brands embraced their roles in gamer culture, even sponsoring esports tournaments and online gaming events.\n",
      "\n",
      "Criticisms and Controversies\n",
      "Despite their popularity, both products have been criticized for their nutritional content. MTN DEW is high in sugar and caffeine, and Doritos are calorie-dense and often high in sodium. Health experts have raised concerns about their role in unhealthy snacking habits, particularly among youth. Still, both brands continue to thrive, largely due to their effective marketing and cultural relevance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "MTN DEW and Doritos represent more than just snacks—they symbolize a lifestyle for many. Whether it's during a LAN party, a movie night, or a meme-fueled scroll through social media, this dynamic duo holds a permanent place in the collective consciousness of modern snack culture. Bold, colorful, and uniquely tuned to their audience, they continue to evolve while staying true to their extreme, fun-loving roots.\n",

      "3234/12571 | 76561199065380818 → I’ve sunk over 1,000 hours into OW 2. The core gameplay is fast, fluid, and incredibly satisfying. No matter how chaotic it gets, there's a rhythm to the fights that just feels right. When you're clicking, timing abilities perfectly, and coordinating with your team, it’s genuinely some of the most fun you can have in a multiplayer shooter.\n",
      "That said, this game also drives me insane sometimes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hero balance has always been one of biggest struggles, and in OW 2 it feels like a never ending pendulum swing. One patch a hero is completely broken, the next they’re borderline useless. Some heroes get overbuffed for no reason, others stay weak for months. Blizzard seems to balance based more on pick rates than actual gameplay feel. The meta changes a lot, but it often swings toward frustrating compositions whether it’s unkillable tanks, unfun cheese picks, or oppressive reworks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there’s matchmaking. It has improved since the early days of OW 2, but it still feels inconsistent. Sometimes you get great, even matches. Other times it's a complete stomp one way or the other, especially in solo queue. Competitive ranks feel messy like you’re either climbing easily or stuck in purgatory. The new ranking system hides too much behind vague icons, and it often feels like you’re not sure if you're improving or just lucky.\n",
      "\n",
      "PvE? Forget about it. The big campaign they hyped at launch is dead. What we got instead were a few limited time co-op missions that were fun for a day and then forgotten. Honestly, it feels like they gave up on that entire side of the game, and it sucks because the Overwatch universe deserves real story content.\n",
      "\n",
      "Monetization is another hot topic. Yes, the store is overpriced. But to be fair, if you actually play the game a lot, they do hand out a surprising amount of skins for free now. I’ve earned dozens of legendary skins without spending money. As long as you grind the weekly challenges and events, you’ll build a solid collection over time. It's still a bit grindy, but way better than the first year of OW2.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the end of the day, I keep playing because despite all the problems, the moment to moment gameplay is just that good. When you have a good match, when a team fight turns on one clutch ult or a perfect support play, it's satisfying. But be warned, it comes with a lot of rough patches, questionable balance decisions, dev silence, and a system that sometimes feels like it rewards chaos more than coordination.\n",

Even at it's worse during 2023-early 2024 the core game play is so engaging in fun it still keeps you hooked. These characters are instantly recognizable and lovable. Even for the characters you hate going against like Wrecking ball, doom they're personalities still shine through their kits and voice lines truly making this world believable beyond the chaotic hero shooter game play. Before I wouldn't really recommend this game to many. It was full of false PvE promises and really had no new content to look forward to. But since the launch of Stadium I have been recommending this to all my friends and we have all gotten back into overwatch because of it. Stadium feels like an entirely whole new game to dip your toes into. I could only describe it as the magic of when overwatch first launched in 2016. The matches are insanely fun and different each and every time. It's infinitely re-playable with the crazy amount of different builds you can correct. If you haven't given overwatch a try and especially if you enjoyed rivals I heavily recommend checking this one out. Having a blast and excited and hopeful they can keep this momentum going.\n",

The game has some new heroes that are genuinely fun to play at their core, and honestly, the balancing doesn't feel too bad right now.

They claim I broke \"community guidelines\" but I do not swear in chat, I rarely use voice chat at all as it is, I do not trash talk hardly at all. It was after I took a year long hiatus from the game that I was banned, and when I appealed the ban, Blizzard said that their review showed the ban was justified, but they refused to explain WHAT I actually was banned for specifically.

      "\n",
      "I have 2000 hours and I primarily played ranked for those hours, this was before the game hit steam. Overwatch 2 is an unfortunate business decision made by higher ups at BlizzAct to try and generate new hype for a game people already played and liked. Alot of promises that they could not fulfill at \"Launch\" have been retrofitted into new game modes and ideas. Credit where credit is due, the devs heard the issues and tried with corporate eyes watching them.\n",

      "\n",
      "Ranked Mode and Toxicity are always going to be prevalent in games like this, ask any league of legends player what issues the game has and how much time they play and you'll hear the same complaints. Popular games become toxic. It's not an excuse for the game to remain toxic though, in fact most games beyond overwatch could use better moderation tools to reduce how negative the player-to-player engagement feels. Overwatch is full of weirdly egotistical players that feel like playing 100 hours of exclusively Junkrat means you should belittle/demean people. Congrats on the time but no normal person just trying to have fun cares that much about winning a casual match. I wish reporting wasn't just a tool for banning people that annoy you, but an actual moderation system.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Long answer: I have NEVER played OverWatch 1. I started playing OW2 on its release and i have loved it ever since. Its a super fun game to play with friends / just one friend and can be quite fun to play alone even tho i wouldnt recommend it at all lol. The game is super easy to get into and is super complex for people who want to dedicate themselves to it. There are so many ways to play this game, different game modes, map objectives, characters, character interactions. Even though the lore is limited the characters talking to each other is so fun, all the ult lines play in my head over and over before i go to sleep, i LOVE this game. I love 5v5 and i love 6v6, i love the new Stadium and i still love the core game. I love how the game has developed since Marvel Rivals lol. Hero bans are exactly what i NEEDED in this game to be perfect, map votes are meh, but the game has locked in and i love it. I hope for it to develop further and just continue being better.\n",

Also this game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ MASSIVE, you need SOO much storage for this game which is also a negative, and the main reason i couldnt get some of my friends into the game, however if you have the space if give this game a chance cause i think its worth it.\n",

But that time is long gone.

The quantity of whiny people that demand to look at your profile is just ridiculous.

Anyway dont play this mess of a game that used to be its just junk i play the game do to my friends and family liked overwatch 1 and this is all we have now.\n",

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

The sad part is that blizzard wont ban actual racists, people telling others to kill their self, but will ban people for saying \"group up\", \"stop overextending\", \"dont be a dumbass and play with the team.\" They have an automated ban system so once you get x amount of reports, youre gone. it dont maater. a game master wont review it either, its also automated. The skins have become so expensive and a giant ass joke i really dont comprehend how people still spend money on this game. The saddest part of it all? Blizzard and everyone knows they made a good ass hero shooter, but now theyre killing it.

What broke the final straw was a silence ban I received over standing up against people who were being toxic to others during quick play matches as well as those who would constantly harass others for the characters they played. Mind you this was my first offense and the ban goes for two weeks. What I have learned is that they are promoting those who are allowed to exhibit toxic behavior to those who wish to enjoy a game and have fun and ban those who are doing the right thing to stand up to others. I uninstalled the game and refuse to play it anymore due to these circumstances. Despite loving all the characters I learned how to be good at and enjoying the game with my friends, if Blizzard wishes to endorse those who are toxic towards others instead of creating a healthier community I want no part in it. Overwatch was one of my favorite games to play with friends and my partners, but given these circumstances I don't see myself returning to the community till the nepotism is fixed.\n",

      "4437/12571 | 76561198401394611 → Come snowball, they need us.\n",
      "4438/12571 | 76561198844625978 → I downloaded this trash from Steam just to give the worst possible assessment.So come on: To the beginning of everything, this game has the worst match organization I've ever seen compared to any other big FPS game that exists.In addition to making you fall with people who have virtually never played a shooting game in life, he puts you against people who are in mind Smurf and you as a player who really wants to climb out, can never get out of division links (Platinum gold for eg).In addition to the detail that if you fall with a good group, that is, players who have won from other matches, the game itself ends the match for \"unexpected server error\" or someone from your team, or the opposing team to end the match and forcing you to pull another with the worst existing group, leading you to defeat and not letting you progress in the ranking.This is when you do not pay you early on, making you get suspension for minutes or hours and if you can still return the match, regardless of whether you win or lose, it still has suspension.This is something that happens often.\n",
      "Now speaking of the recommendation and banishment system, it is (if not) worse than exists either, that level of recommendation is no good, since (in an old account) I arrived at recommendation 4 and yet fall with recommendation players 2 and 1 that always made you regress in the ranking of your link or falling as a link.Why is this then ???Just not to let you communicate in the match ??Useless and rotten system.And going beyond, after playing this game a lot, I realized that the reward system by match (percentage of ranking progress) is exactly the same as a gambling.When you win, it is little progress, and gets lost, loses the triple.What incentive is there?It only makes you addicted, nervous and unmotivated, until it makes you abandon the game (as I have already seen many abandon).And they still say this is an inclusive game !!Now speaking of the banishment/punishment system that only punishes who (tries) to make the match work, it is another trash work of these unacceptive devs/mods that simply do not help you at all, since you can take chat restriction or even lose your account permanently because of \"misconduct and violation of the community\" (as it happened with my first 4 -year -old), because you like the game or commented on the matchInfos/Suggestions for your team or just by commenting on GG on chat.Do not think that resorting to the support will serve as something, because for that it does not exist (for almost nothing actually).\n",
      "Their despair was so great that, seeing that the number of players was down (with queues up to 10 min) brought back the lootbox (but increased the price of everything), character ban (in low link, only Banem Shadow and Zayra), 3rd person vision (with lag) and even choice of maps!They are doing their best to keep players, throwing mythical skins and fi.da outfits (overpriced), but they are c@g@nds for the things I mentioned above.\n",
      "Anyway, there are many more details that I don't remember now, but in the future I come to edit here.I played this game in 2016/17, even though it was not my FPS of interest (played R6), since (unfairly) won the game of the year and when they released the 2 I saw a very positive evolution, but now I see it was wrong (nor quoting their lie that would have a \"story\" mode, just after adding the mode, only in a paid extension and face).\n",
      "My advice for those who start playing this game is that you will be very frustrated very, really.Because even if you play just to spend time, after a time of experience, you will end up stressing and abandoning.And if you play with a group of friends, in the game itself there is something called the \"Waiting Row for Dynamic Group\", which means that if you are playing with a complete group of friends or have at least 3, the game tries to put you against players in the same situation and increases the waiting time in line (I myself had to wait about 25min, when I was in a full group and yet \"the group was broken\".So besides demotivating to play solo, he also demotivates you strongly when throwing himself with friends, or friends you make in the game, all for the \"skill balancing\" that in their mind makes a total sense.So good luck.\n",
      "They virtually do not play their own game.And the opinion of the players (especially here) show the result.\n",

Also, in the games that i played, it seemed like the toxicity had left and moved to marvel rivals as well, as most the people i talked to were nice.

      "5182/12571 | 76561199073135108 → Its less about the gameplay and more about them making money off cosmetics and collabs, and its kinda evident by how little care is given to the game at the end of the day my main two issues is having an ethernet cable for my PC so i dont have lag issues but still getting kicked mid match and then it wont let me back in unless i restart the game and with doing that i cant rejoin and just get suspended, My second issue is their story that people payed for just for three mission and an event mission just for it to then be abandoned which suck because it was kinda good and introduced a great character in Ramattra who they now pretty much neglect unless hes convinent for a skin, which makes the story seem like it was initially just to introduce Ramattra and that's it and if that is the case why have people pay for it which then plays into them only keeping the game going just for money.\n",

At this point I only play it because my friends play it and it's easy to pick up again, due to the hours I've already sunk into it, but this game has a list of issues a mile long. I'm currently having fun with stadium, and I think it's the best thing Blizzard has done for the game since they added Sigma (my beloved), but it stands to reason that for most people, this isn't enough for a game that's nearing its 10 year anniversary. I would not recommend anyone pick this game up if they aren't already invested, but for those that are, I think the game is in a better spot now than it was a few years ago. The micro-transactions are still really bad, though.\n",

      "5348/12571 | 76561198348714359 → The game is good, and for the first 20 hours it's actually really fun. But some things are just so incredibly annoying and frustrating so often that it's hard to play the game while having fun. Some characters feel just absolutely broken with some being able to instantly heal themselves without a team, but nothing is as bad as the matchmaking. The matchmaking for Overwatch 2 is nothing short of just god awful, don't bother playing with friends if you plan on winning at all, as you'll just be placed in a round against 6 people who are 20x your experience level. And that's only when playing with ONE FRIEND who is even a level lower than I am. Also, you better pray to god you don't have anyone on console, otherwise your entire team might as well be one man down the whole round, and if your whole party except for you is console? You guessed it, you get full PC 6 teams. Maybe you've had enough with that and want to play solo, and win a bit, but guess what? Nope, you're going against a team of 6 party members who are ALSO way more experienced than you. I have no idea why, but at around level 40 the game tends to do nothing but pair you with parties of 6 heavily experienced players. Yes, it's a multiplayer game, and yes, communication fixes all of this, but come on... no one will ever actually communicate in a server, and even then, the communication only gets you so far. The matchmaking system consistently gives you opponents way stronger than you are, and punishes you for leaving games like that. There's not even an escape from it, either. Having even one PC player in your party gives you PC lobbies, which by the way, are filled with sweats and demolish your entire team no matter what you do. Essentially, every match is either; just wrecking everything in your path and actually winning, which is rare, or just joining an already loosing round or just being completely steamrolled by essentially an E-sports team of 6. It's fun but only to a point. If the matchmaking was even slightly fixed the game would be 100x better, but I don't see that coming anytime soon. The only reason this makes me not recommend the game is because issues like this ARE solvable, and they CAN fix nearly every balancing issue without major match queue differences, but they just wont, and that's why I'm mad about it. I believe that only parties should fight against parties with only solo players being added if there is an odd number of players. (say there is a team of 6 and then two parties of 2 and then 3, a solo player could be added.) this way those who are in parties and already expecting another party will only fight against other parties and reduce the amount of solo players mixed in with teams of incredibly over-experienced players. If anyone else has similar ideas, please say it here, maybe, just maybe they might change it to be a bit more fun for casual players.\n",
      "\n",
      "Side note - I'm not an experienced player, no, but myself and other friends that have played this game agree that the matchmaking is awful, and even with little time in the game, it very quickly get's unfun, which sucks as I did really enjoy the game before it started putting me against parties. And I should say I am not a long time follower of this game since Overwatch 1, but these are my thoughts anyways. Also when I say my friends and I are in a party sometimes, we are playing casually, same with when I am playing solo.\n",

      "I was here for the very beginning of Overwatch 1, I loved that game and spent a lot of time playing it (eventually quit after Season 3), and while they made some questionable changes to this iteration of the game, I can't help but say a lot of the hate against this game seems unwarranted. I've had the fortune to play the game in it's infancy and at the point it is now, and I genuinely think it's headed in a fantastic direction. One thing this game has over Marvel Rivals is that (for me at least), playing the game is actually FUN and the community is SO much better in my experience. And you don't have to deal with Unreal Engine 5 deciding to crash every game.\n",

      "5704/12571 | 76561199055498500 → When I returned, I had already played with Zhan.com. Today I saw it and talked about the current watch.No matter what, ow is always the first in my heart.Wo's action, art, plot, music and other things are all top-notch.However, there are some things that are more difficult to describe in the current art and plot than in 1. However, because the funds are in place, the update will be faster. The skin has more blocks, more maps, and more new heroes.(In the later period of 1, a hero was released in one or two years, which made me always think that Sigma and echo are new heroes) This is the advantage range of 1 and 2.But the game must be updated to survive.Let’s talk about gameplay. If you don’t talk about the balance, the most important thing is that it is more difficult to get started with T and milk by 6 people.The game mainly plays a good fight, and the entire 90% time is about ten seconds to resurrect the fight.If you choose someone to buy equipment in other games, you may use half of the game time to die once and have to wait for the next round and take a long time.This is also the reason why I like this game (I like the Finals, it’s also very good. It’s not that I don’t want to play too stuck, so I’m waiting for the national server now). Moreover, this game is actually more friendly to novices and without a basic aiming foundation. You can play weak aiming as long as you can use the mouse and keyboard, big hammer, crazy rat, Moira, Angel, Flower Male Orangutan (it’s easy to master orangutan).The gameplay is quite diverse because of customization, and the official has also released a new level gameplay in the duel field.If nothing unexpected happens in the future, more fun modes will appear.Next, let’s talk about the game environment, which has a certain relationship with the game. OW is a team game, so whether a person can play it can really determine the winner or lose.So everyone is very angry.If someone has communication and it is not their own problem, I personally think there is nothing wrong with scolding people, but I don’t recommend not communicating in a game. Then there is a sudden outbreak of some invalid communication.It is impossible to say that I will teach you how to play this sentence and then suddenly realize it.I have said too much, in short, 95% of the voice in competitive sports is that everyone is not in voice or attacking each other, and only communicates a little bit.So if you don't have any requirements for competitive performance, I highly recommend playing fast, the pressure is much smaller, the content of the game is indeed the same, and it won't ban the hero you want to play.\n",
      "What I am talking about below is myself. I got into the trap in 20 years and was given by the UU accelerator at that time.I won’t talk about the memories for the time being.It has always been impossible for me to actively attack anyone who is playing games. At most, I can interact occasionally. Now I have grown up and have less than before, so my appreciation is quite high. It is stable at level 3 at 1, and now it is stable at level 4.My position has also changed a lot in the game because I have always liked to play Iron Fist. At 1, the duration of the Iron Fist game accounted for 95% of the total heroes. Now the Iron Fist of 2 has been adjusted to t, so I am mainly playing t now.And influenced by several anchors, I began to try to play different Ts to broaden my hero pool.The original words are probably: If you are specialized, but Kant can't beat the opponent, and you still don't change it, then it's a cancer. The most important way to play this game is \"H\". Yes, as long as you are willing to change it, at least you won't be uncomfortable to play it all the time.I no longer miss 1's iron fist so much because people can't live in the past. Although the iron fist is quite fun now, if I can only choose one, I will definitely choose 1's iron fist. But people have to look forward, just like the iron fist in the game background, from 1's arrogant self-confidence to 2's maturity and stability. And his lines are that I adapt to the team, not to let the team adapt to me.I definitely won’t cheat if I play games, because I always feel that there is nothing worth talking about if I don’t rely on my own strength to go up, even if I may not be able to go up at all (currently the highest platinum 1), and I think I still have a lot of opportunities.But if the bug is intentionally or unintentionally, it may be stuck. This is not accurate. Anyway, I will not rely on these external things to gain points.If I have the chance to keep playing later, I think I might try to communicate as much as possible.If you play, you should have been playing alone. Anyway, I have been used to it for so many years.\n",
      "To be honest, I don’t have the emotions in the game (the black shadow is quite disgusting). I just like Moira a little annoyed when I see the background story. I really like other heroes. My personal favorite hero: Doomsday Iron Fist: Fun, there are many memes, and it’s quite charming.Genji: handsome.Tanqi: I really like this lively and sunny character more and more. Modeling is indeed a bit abstract, but the original painting is quite beautiful.Black lily: good-looking.I wonder what heroes everyone likes?\n",

      "5774/12571 | 76561199519149427 → The first FPS game for college students.\n",
      "I didn’t have time or equipment before college, unlike some friends who have been exposed to this type of game since elementary and junior high school.I don't have a basic FPS, but I think this game needs to be very accurate in output points. If the marksmanship is not good, you can also play other things. My favorite character is Faying Jiang.Rocket launchers and rocket barrage are really useful.I've taken the Faying Sauce several times the best in the game!!!!happy.The French Eagle Sauce is very handsome, the very charming and handsome, which is different from the awkward handsomeness that comes out of hard.In my eyes, she is a very resolute woman who knows the meaning of protection.\n",
      "I also met many friends in this game, such as Dali, Xiaomei Aunt, Faji Ge, Index, Miaomiao... The person I met at the beginning was found by me from posting on xhh, because I played in the Asian server for 40 hours and were always scolded by people, and some Chinese people even denied me the words to scold me.I felt very wronged at that time, so I posted a post, and someone said I could play with me.I gained my first group of friends.Dali was a game that I met one night in January this year. At that time, I was playing Nana and she was playing Angel.I'm very good at protecting it.After playing the support position for a long time, I feel it is easy to see the attitude of the other support position.It's really hard to support. Sometimes it's very stressful to play support.Because it is easy to be stressed by t and c.I am also a person with high requirements, but I have poor stress resistance.And some people are obviously trash people, and speaking trash can always hurt me.\n",
      "After the return of the Chinese server, I also played for more than a hundred hours, but in the end I was still very sad. I hate those people in the Chinese server, and my attitude towards ranking is always so bad.I don't want to go into voice communication anymore, nor do I want to open up my team's game chat.I have returned to the international server. Perhaps because of language barriers, the pressure is relatively not that great. Hey, it’s not until how to match it. I always encounter some very inexplicable players.I was trying my best to protect the person, but finally I looked at the panel. I died so many times but didn’t kill anyone, and the harm was not as high as mine.Really tired.\n",
      "I think it might be easier to play the game.\n",
      "In March this year, our school ow players organized an entertainment competition.I saw it and went to participate. I was half a novice. If I compared it with those veterans, I definitely had no chance of winning, and I couldn’t pick up the dog any more.Well... I also experienced the atmosphere of a competition!Although it is an entertainment competition.\n",
      "I can easily get internal friction when playing ow.It is also easy to get angry because of passers-by.Really angry.I play so seriously every game, but I have to clean up the mess for others.Alas, let alone players, I think this game is very fun.\n",
      "I reviewed the final period last semester and started to wake up in the morning.The characters are also very cute.It would be great if there were more boxes, I really wanted to open a beautiful support skin.\n",

Context: I haven't played any Overwatch since before it became Overwatch 2 on my account, but have touched on it at friends' houses and stuff during 5v5; I've owned the game since release and was an original season 1 competitor. I have never played any amount of Marvel Rivals, so my opinion comes without comparison of other games on the market, and I've decided to let Blizzard's past issues (political and otherwise) stay in the past; they've gone through an acquisition by Microsoft since and had a complete restructuring, so they really deserve another chance.\n",

The volume of characters that are in the game now actually feels good; I haven't noticed a strong meta or anything since I've been playing again, but I bet that becomes much more obvious in competitive play (something that I don't do much of; I'm a casual/arcade player for the most part).\n",

The issue of toxic player, players leaving matches midway through, and negative behavior will be cut by 50% guaranteed if only they allow people to play against ai and yet for their own communities health they spit on that idea of just allowing that one simple trick. Not going to mention the dailies taking 3 matches minimum to complete where as Rivals you just need about 2 and some of the dailies of Overwatch 2 can't be done without 7 other matches because team mates refuse to learn how characters work. IE widows playing widows with Winston or Rinehart or any other sniper that refuses to tear down shields and get out sniped. Allow me, to ignore my team mates and do damage against ai because they sure are doing the same with the situation and throwing. At least i can show them metas are a thing in this game and maybe they'll learn something in the process as to who not to choose. Seriously doubt it but at least I'll be having fun getting MVP every time against ai. If you're going to allow people to be braindead in your game, please allow me to play against ai, like you promised, and have it count against dailies. It'll never happen, so anyone still reading this, hop on over to Marvel Rivals and have fun against ai. It's the Overwatch 2 we're promised.\n",

      "6164/12571 | 76561199031898128 → Overwatch has had its ups and downs throughout the years and as a person who has been following this game since damn near launch time it has been a pleasure to be along for the hectic ride. Just to talk a little about Overwatch 1 I thought around the time I first played it, the game was one of if not the best multiplayer games I've ever played and even to this day I still hold that opinion well before GOATS meta (those who know) and that magic of Overwatch from 2016-2018 is something that I have yet to see be recreated (yes Marvel Rivals on launch was definitely worse than Overwatch release).\n",
      "\n",
      "Enough talk about OW1 stuff. Overwatch 2, likewise to many in the community, was a massive disappointment on so many different fronts from the 5v5 being turned into the primary method of playing to all the content that was supposed to be given to fans that eventually was just cut off in general. Overwatch 2 represented Blizzard at its worst just using a once former great IP/game in order to make a quick buck. For many, including me and many friends, that was most of our breaking point in quitting this game and calling it a trashcan of a game and something that only some could reminisce on.\n",
      "\n",
      "But recently I have got back into this game because of the craze of Marvel Rivals and me finally picking up hero shooters after a couple of years and being dissatisfied with the state of that game. I finally decided to give OW2 another chance and wow they genuinely surprised me with a lot of these changes done. Obviously there are still many things that are very wrong with the game like how it has turned into a microtransaction hell and how making players pay $80 for somewhat okay cosmetics makes me think the devs ride the shortbus. But excluding that major flag, the perk system is something that I was very skeptical of when I first picked up this game again and even now I’m not completely used to it but personally I feel it has been a great addition to the game adding some depth and uniqueness to all old and new heroes alike. Having the ability to decide whether with someone like Junker Queen if I want to gain more lifesteal off my axe or my shotgun makes a massive difference not only on how I will play but also think about how to counter the enemy team.\n",
      "\n",
      "And although they definitely took a hell of a lot of inspiration from another hero shooter game out there, bans were also something that I am glad they finally implemented. This was a feature back around 2018 a small portion of the community was begging for obvious reasons (Brigitte) and now finally seeing it in the game has put a smile on my face like nothing else. Seeing the heroes I don't want to deal with or that might be a tad overtuned being banned and feeling some control over that makes the experience a lot better than what it used to be.\n",
      "\n",
      "And finally, and probably the biggest, is adding back 6v6. Look I get it, some folks enjoy and think that 5v5 is good but I'm sorry I could never get into it. Personally when I first played Overwatch 2 it didn't feel like Overwatch. Not having that precious offtank or god forbid 3rd DPS (LMAO) brought a sense of emptiness to the game that was enjoyed by me personally. But now that 6v6 is back, it gives players like me the agency to decide what I want to play.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall Overwatch has immensely improved. Other than the microtransaction hell, I think Overwatch has actually slowly rebuilt not only their image but their reputation and hopefully they can keep going on this streak of good changes.\n",

The entire game has no progression other than ranked unless you want to spend money and the battle pass is filled with garbage you don't even want until you spend about 50 hours of game play unlocking everything. The matchmaking is horrible. You either walk all over the enemy team or you get walked in every game unless you're a really high rank, which, for a newer player, is a horrible experience to achieve, because once you're a low rank, it's very hard to get a good team while the enemy team likely has an E Sports like comp with communication. This isn't the game you play as an employed person in society. It's a game teenagers play, and content creators play because they have the time to get good enough to enjoy it.\n",

It just doesn’t offer anything substantially different compared to OW, and I have a hard time believing that most if not all of the new content could have just been implemented in updates. Instead, the entirely new game reads like Blizzard shooting itself in the foot by trying to recreate a player base they ALREADY HAD for no good reason.\n",

More often than not, I’ll leave games with an actual headache.\n",
      "Lastly, and what feels like a f*ck you to me specifically, the 5v5 comp takes out any and all fun that came from being a tank. Instead of being an important part of a functional team where you may need to swap on occasion, the tank gameplay in OW2 feels like the worst game of rock paper scissors ever, where your counterswapping becomes the only thing keeping your team from being smoothie blended into oblivion. And on top of that, all the tanks that benefited from having a partner in OW are essentially useless now. No wonder the tank queue is <1min 90% of the time despite there only being ONE PER TEAM. Comp-based games shouldn’t have roles that explicitly suck to be in! It’s a game, it should be fun!\n",

The fish frying was full of novices. The matching system was normal for the time being, and now it was rotten. Ordinary players can match the top 500 games. In competitive competitions, 3500 games can match gold. People play with their heads. You can win games that can be hung up and have expressions. You can win games that cannot be won. You can't win games that have a burst of touch and can't win. There is no normal game at all. Don't get into the trap. If you really want to play, don't come to the national server. Shit in shit.

Another reason to support my theme is, Just the rest of the game. It is always bright and i don't see any butts. All are smaller then my wiener.

      "I hate to admit this, but I think this game is getting a lot better- the competition between it and Marvel Rivals suddenly got the developers of this game to start focusing on OW2, when before it was just an Overwatch 1.1 as others have described- but I don't think what they've added, and even plan to add is enough for this game.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the new entry of 'Stadium Mode', and eventually it being a custom game mode with workshop features in estimated 2 seasons, I believe OW2 will regain popularity pretty quickly- Stadium is pretty overpowered and takes a while to figure out how to use, but when you do it is incredibly fun due to build variety and just build overpoweredness- on all sides to the point of it being actually pretty balanced (minus Moira, please for the love of god why does Moira have 1000+ HP and heals it all back with 1 fade.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Although stadium mode is 'great and all', that's not what really got me to leave a positive review- it was actually the fact that they re-introduced loot boxes into the game, giving free cosmetics ranging from common-legendary, the visuals of these loot-boxes suck compared to how they were in OW1- which really makes it less enjoyable to open these loot boxes. But if you look at it as a game with a history of being solely cash-grab, pricing a skin at $19.99 and more, it's beginning to re-iterate itself to be less anti-consumer...\n",
      "\n",
      "As someone who has spent $0 on the game (keep in my mind my playtime of 300 hours), I have two 'mythic' skins, at least 1 legendary skin for every character, and a bunch of other skins between various characters, despite what everyone is saying- no you don't need to spend a single dime to get good skins, you can even get every other battle pass completely for free if you are active enough in the seasons- meaning mythic prisms are obtainable by getting the battle pass for free.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nonetheless, the frame-rate is most usually smooth as butter, it's mechanics and hero power designs are very diverse and just overall I'd say great, the 'first person shooter' side of things is also great, but these are all derivative of the first Overwatch- OW2 never brought this along it was just a rebranding of their already well-coded game as means to bring forth their ideas on making more money, which ultimately failed as you can tell from the state of the game.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a free game now, and for a free game it's pretty great, but it's got competition with other insanely good free games like Apex Legends or League of Legends or The Finals or Marvel Rivals or otherwise... In that regard, I would say it is relatively on the low-end in terms of quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the addition of lootboxes and just getting coins by leveling up on battle-pass, given enough time, when it comes to free cosmetics- there isn't really a skin you can't have besides skins that are time-limited and appear at unlucky timings- even mythic skins can become yours given the ability to get the battle pass for free.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a Hero Shooter FPS, it did define or at least heavily popularized the idea, most likely having been cause of inspiration to bringing birth to games like Marvel Rivals. If you had to pick between the two, I'd say Overwatch just has more content, smoother gameplay, and is First-person (which in my personal preference is better).\n",

      "Honestly, if you are new to Overwatch, you will probably really enjoy this game- but vets who know the glory days will dislike this game, and probably no matter what Blizzard does to try and fix it, it will probably be met with a Mostly Negative opinionated fan-base of the game, stuck to the game as per their Nostalgia, and also how fun and addictive of a game it is.\n",

      "- A very large roster to choose from.\n",
      "- Most heroes are entirely unique\n",
      "- (?) Characters are diverse (If you're the weirdo that cares about this.)\n",
      "- All relevant information in game is intuitively designed and call outs are distinct enough you will understand their intentions easily.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cons:\n",
      "- Anything relating to real money.\n",
      "- Dialogue which while relative to meta, means if you're in a meta that favors popular characters, you will hear a handful of interactions and nothing else.\n",
      "- Most characters are caricatures\n",
      "- Much of the design is based on OW1, and does not fit OW2. As such many things do not translate well. (Characters, Maps, Kit design, etc.\n",
      "- It is a very mobile game, if you struggle with aiming, this game will punish you immensely for it.\n",
      "- A very beginner unfriendly game. It lives by \"trial by fire\"\n",
      "- Nature of the game means players are toxic.\n",

      "6911/12571 | 76561198158502825 → There was a time when the name Overwatch inspired joy, camaraderie, and limitless potential. It stood as a vibrant symbol of what online team-based shooters could be — fast, fluid, strategic, and fun. Released in 2016, the original Overwatch united millions under the banner of colorful characters, tightly tuned gameplay, and a developer that seemed to care. It was bold, refreshing, and rich with possibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward to Overwatch 2, and what remains is a hollow monument to corporate misdirection, unfulfilled promises, and live-service greed. It is not a sequel — it is a marketing rebrand. A husk of a once-great game, sold back to us under a new name with fewer features, less soul, and a much larger price tag.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overwatch 2 was sold to the public as a meaningful evolution. We were promised an ambitious PvE mode, deeper storytelling, persistent hero progression, and a bold new direction. What we got was… Overwatch 1.1, minus a tank, plus a battle pass.\n",
      "\n",
      "The PvE content that was marketed as the cornerstone of the sequel — the very thing that made it “Overwatch 2” — was quietly canceled after years of hype. A few dull, replayable missions were released to fulfill the bare minimum of that promise, then the whole initiative was shelved. What was once a promise of growth became a public admission of creative bankruptcy.\n",
      "And so, we’re left with the same core PvP experience — only now, it’s more chaotic, less balanced, and increasingly hostile to casual and returning players. The original Overwatch had a loot box system — far from perfect, but you could still earn skins through gameplay. Now, you’re charged $19.99 for a single cosmetic. That’s nearly the price of an entire game — for a skin that’s barely visible during gameplay.\n",

They have so many options for so many people, but people only play one mode and complain about how the game is unfair.

Same issue in Hearthstone, hype up the new arena game mode only for there to be so many bugs, even affecting other game modes like Battlegrounds where I literally couldn't sell a minion because it said \"Minions cannot attack the turn they are played\".

      "I played Overwatch 2 since the release and, Man ... what a mix of feelings.There are times when I love, there are times when I want to uninstall.I'll tell you the real!\n",
      "\n",
      "What made me keep playing:\n",
      "✅ Addictive gameplay - Nothing beats the feeling of hitting a headshot with Widowmaker or saving the team with a perfect one from Ana. The gameplay is as hot as it is on OW1.\n",
      "\n",
      "✅ Unique and charismatic heroes - each character has a striking personality.Junker Queen and Kiriko are amazing additions, with skills that change the game.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Push\" mode and new maps - though controversial, I like the push (that of the giant robot).Maps like Circuit Royal and Paradise are beautiful and fun to play.\n",
      "\n",
      "✅ Free (but asterisk) - If you have never played overwatch, now you can come in free.But ... (see the negative points).\n",
      "\n",
      "Which made me want to throw the PC through the window:\n",
      "❌ Battle Pass and aggressive monetization - 20 tale by skin is absurd.In OW1, you won loot boxes for free.Now everything is expensive and time consuming to unlock.\n",
      "\n",
      "❌ Less content promised - where is the complete PVE mode?What they released was a shadow of what was announced.\n",
      "\n",
      "Questionable Balancing - Some heroes are broken for months (look you, mauga), while others are forgotten (poor Mercy).\n",
      "\n",
      "❌ Toxic Community-If you do not play goal, get ready to take hate.And the voice chat?Better to mutate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Personal Verdit:\n",
      "If you already have friends to play, it can be fun.But if it is soil, the experience is much more frustrating than in OW1.\n",

After 5-10 games of that, im fed a healthy streak of easy Ws against teams of crayon eating monkeys where it feels as if im playing against children. It is a completely inauthentic experience. Mind you, this is happening in QUICK PLAY. This game is NOT made for people that actually have lives and that are looking to have fun.

To put it bluntly, it doesn't have enough places to make me want to go to study. I'll be scolded when I play with matches occasionally.

      "For some people the thing that forms their life into one direction or another is football, art, music etc. To me, yeah kinda awkward and nerdy, it is overwatch. At the end of the day I still regularly (sometimes daily) sit down to play this. I started playing ow 1 in 2016 when I was 17 and living with my mom, because I got it as a gift. I didn't like it, but just like drinking a beer, I started enjoying it after many tries.\n",
      "In 2017 I met someone special in comp and that turned into over 3 years long relationship. I met my best friend to this day in comp as well in 2019. Even my first tattoo is from this game (2020) and one of my cats is named as Genji.\n",
      "I have gotten so many amazing friends throughout the years (sadly most of them have slowly disappeared from my life tho). Some I still miss, some are in the past for a reason. Nowadays I'm mostly playing with two friends I met in 2024.\n",
      "It's a shame to notice how socializing in this game has gotten harder? I don't meet new friends that easily anymore. Is it me or is it a common thing, idk. I enjoy playing alone too so that's not big of a deal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overwatch has been my way to relax for all these years. Yeah, sometimes I'm so pissed and sometimes toxicity makes me reconsider if I REALLY want to spend my time here. But I always come back, even after group of 12 years old boys have spent a whole match bullying me XD. It's like a toxic ex who somehow manipulates me back.\n",

      "We all should know at this point why there is so much hate in the air, so I'm not going to talk about that. I just want to comment on a few things I hear people cry about.\n",
      "\n",
      "First of all, I'm not mad at blizzard selling skins that cost a fortune... I don't need to buy them. Having a cool skin won't change the gameplay. It's a free game to play! Whining about skin prices is like going to a clothing store even though you have enough clothes to keep you warm and crying because everything is so expensive. You do not need them in order to play.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, I didn't give a flying bird about getting a PvE, storymode and so on. All I ever wanted was more maps, heroes and events. I feel like so many people are mad for something they didn't even really want :D But yes, I get it, don't promise what you won't deliver. I was sad only because blizzard stopped giving anything at all for a long while when ow2 was on its way, but I wasn't very excited on the things they were promising.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly I can't call this game bad. Not even if enemy Freya kills me 20 times during one match. I can't give a negative review to something that has made a huge impact on me and who I am today. I even moved cities because of someone I met IN THIS GAME which led to me meeting the partner I am living with today.\n",

      "Since the new stadium mode was launched in Overwatch 2, the general performance of the game has gone into minced.Before this update, OW2 was much better optimized: there were no serious lows of fps, the games were fluid and the game felt stable even in mid -range equipment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, with the active stadium mode, it is quite the opposite.FPS declines are constant, the input lag is notorious and in some cases the game freezes or closes for no reason.The most worrying thing is that this mode seems to be designed only for those who have a high -end PC, with maximum specifications.If you do not have a powerful machine, you can basically enjoy this content.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is very disappointing that an update ends up limiting access to part of the game, affecting a large part of the community that does not have latest generation hardware.The development team needs to take these problems seriously and launch an urgent solution.Otherwise, the stadium mode will be remembered for its bad performance than for its gameplay.\n",

The developers are misguided, and frankly, useless. Content updates are slim and only bring in new overpriced cosmetics. Smurfs run rampant. Balance changes are abysmal. 5v5 is horrendous and only serves to make the game a far more stressful experience for everyone. And because of it all the games player-base has drastically shrunk over the past few years. The only people who've stuck with it are the devoted - you won't be finding a balanced match if you don't dedicate your every waking moment to the game.\n",

      "Overwatch Despite all the controversies is in a \"stable\" state now coming from their latest updates such as the addition of stadium mode (my sincere congratulations, it only took all this to deliver a fun mode after Luciobol) and the heroes' banings in competitive matches, which we had too long.\n",

I mean unless you have a group of friends you play with then yeah it it could be fun. also it could be a stylistic choice the gameplay does a lot of stuff going on.

Competitive used to be addicting and had a perfect ranking system, pushed me to play to rank 10 U.S. New ranked system is so bad idc if I’m in bronze I have no incentive to push and every game is unrewarding, dependent on the horrible matchmaking system, and feels like trash.

      "7937/12571 | 76561198979603874 → I personally like the game itself.There are dynamic matches, a small threshold of entry and I go here after Arena Breakout Infinite to remove the shaking.For me, the game is available without crutches, since I am from Kazakhstan, but yesterday I wanted to play with a friend from the Russian Federation and naturally nothing came out for us.Maybe bypass paths and there was already a night and we were too lazy to look for a way to establish it.Purely for this, obviously a political decision, I cannot appreciate it positively.Developers, if you want to fight with the Russians, then take the machines in the claw and pi3duate to the front, and do not behave like degenerates.In any case, we will find what to play, there are enough games, and you can wish you a speedy recovery.\n",

      "7944/12571 | 76561198055986245 → If you are not familiar with Overwatch, don't let the negative reviews or the few toxic marvel rival players make you not try this game. Many of the negative reviews came from review bombing when it first came out on steam and a lot of the criticism was justified at the time as blizzard was doing blizzard things. Other criticism is not warranted without having that same criticism or more on other free to play games like valorant, apex legends, or marvel rivals. Despite blizzard trying their best to make the game worse, I believe the dev team based on their frequent interviews and game blogs do truly care and listen to their fans. The game itself is extremely fun and is one of the most well optimized shooters out there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overwatch 2 has always been a great game to play and personally I have found the transition to free to play an overall net positive primarily due to the sheer amount of content and updates the game now receives. The dev team has stated and so far committed to their update schedule of a new hero every other season (seasons are 2 months long) and a complete \"refresh\" of the game every year. This year's refresh was the implementation of perks.\n",
      "\n",
      "While not included in the yearly refresh, the game also introduced the stadium game mode which in my opinion is much bigger than perks even though I do love the addition of perks. I have personally found this new game mode to almost feel like a new game which is what long time overwatch players have been needing to come back. I look forward to more of the hero roster being added to stadium in the coming seasons.\n",
      "\n",
      "More regarding negative reviews of the game. Just like any free to play game, there are going to be micro-transactions that are too much money and I would be lying if I said that did not exist. There is a shop crammed with $20+ dollar skins just like any other free to play game. People obviously buy them at their current price so the prices are going to stay like that. You can enjoy the game regardless.\n",
      "\n",
      "With that being said regarding monetization, I do think the battle pass is actually a good value if there are skins you like. Unlike some other games, it does not feel as much of a chore to complete the battlepass either. Weekly challenges that make up the bulk of the progress in the BP are able to be completed at any time and carry over progress. This means you can only play during the final week of the season and complete the whole season's weekly challenges. I generally play around 2-3 times a week (much more recently) and have not had much issue completing the battlepass even when going on vacation or not playing for a week or two. The addition of loot boxes is also nice as I have been able to get several of those $20+ skins from the shop for free. I generally play more at the beginning of the season, complete the battlepass at about mid season, and take a break from the game until next season. I'm a little weird and use bing points to always pay for my battlepass but I would also pay the $10 if I didn't have that option.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hope you give the game a try if you haven't or pick the game back up again to try the stadium game mode out. If you don't like it, I get it. Fortunately if you want to stay in the genre, there is also marvel rivals which is also another great game.\n",

The change to only one tank makes the tank role definitive to how the game plays now. Playing tank without dozens of recent hours of experience just leads to your team losing and the other tank calling \"tank diff.\" The PVE mode promise being dropped shows a lack of understanding on what excited OW1 players about OW2.

Horrible character balance, in large part due to the cognitively defunct decision to remove an entire team slot and try to rework everything halfheartedly. The game seemingly grows less dependent on the core mechanics that made it special in its inception and now caters to a fanbase clawing at scraps, unsure if they'll even like something like Marvel Rivals or \"going outside.\" I attempted an earnest go at the newer Stadium game mode, and while it's close to something fun, it feels almost too late. They can introduce third person, MOBA builds, maybe an auto-chess or tower defense game mode down the line, but if the future of this game remains in the hands who have fumbled it thus far then its sure and slow death is all but inevitable.

      "8399/12571 | 76561199092450500 → Overwatch 2 is not a game. It is a cosmic punishment sent by indifferent gods to remind humanity of its insignificance. Booting it up is like willingly inserting your face into a malfunctioning wood chipper. Nothing makes sense. Hitboxes defy physics. abilities are so unbalanced and unfair. you get flamed by your teammates for playing your favourite hero. you get reported and banned for anything you write in global chat. Every match is a dissertation in disappointment, a Shakespearean tragedy written by drunken raccoons on fire. You don't play Overwatch 2 you endure it, like a prisoner endures solitary confinement, counting the cracks in the wall until madness becomes your only friend. Updates break more than they fix, a perpetual motion machine of failure. Watching glue dry is funnier than this game. no in between. Queue times feel longer than the lifespan of stars. And the reward for playing? More battlepass XP so you can suffer again. Again. And again. This game has personally lowered my IQ and ruined my mental health. My dreams are shattered. My hands tremble when I get to the heroes selection screen. If Dante had known about Overwatch 2, there would have been a Tenth Circle of Hell and THIS would be the only thing playing. I would rather be force-fed glass by a rabid moose than ever install this corrupt, festering, soul-devouring, sadness-engine ever again. Overwatch 2 isn’t a free-to-play shooter game. It’s a warning. A cursed artifact. It is a SCREAM into the VOID and the VOID screams back. I have around 964 hours on xbox I used to play this game for fun, now I play it because i hate myself. Playing Overwatch 2 feels like scratching your balls with sandpaper. At first, it’s like, “Yeah, I can handle this, maybe it’s not so bad.” But the longer you do it, the more you realize you're sinking deeper into hell of pure pain and regret. 0/10 experience. I do not recommend. DO NOT click on \"install\" unless you hate yourself and want to spend the rest of your nights in a constant state of depression, pain and regret.\n",

      "8724/12571 | 76561199615425456 → As an old player who has been playing all the way from the first generation of Overwatch, Overwatch ® 2 gives me the feeling that an old friend is trying to break through the comfort zone - there are surprises, running-in, and improvements worthy of recognition.Although the current positive review rate of the Steam page has just exceeded 50%, after several seasons of updates, you can clearly feel that the game is moving towards a more mature direction.\n",
      "Let’s talk about the eye-catching part first.The newly added \"Power Power\" system completely revitalizes the hero's gameplay. For example, when playing Tractor, you can use the skill tree to reset all cooling, making it more flexible to fight pull battles; Tobion's turret can be fixed on the wall and rotate 360 degrees, and it is strategically pulled up directly when defending points.The 6V6 mode returned in the 15th season is simply \"Yiqinghui\". The classic cooperation such as \"hormone knife\" and \"Dragon Blade Receive the Saint\" that old players are familiar with finally no longer unable to perform because of one teammate missing, and the sense of gameplay in team battles is back.The combination of crossbow arrow shooting and explosion traps by the new hero Freya is both pleasant and requires accuracy when operating. After it is launched, it quickly became a popular ranking, which shows her design skills.\n",
      "But there are many controversies.Although the 5V5 mode has accelerated the pace, the front row has a greater pressure on injury, and the single tank has low fault tolerance. It is easy to collapse when encountering teammates who cannot cooperate. This is also the reason why many old players don’t buy it at the beginning.The matching mechanism will occasionally make you mentally erect. For example, after winning streaks, you will suddenly get a few novice teammates, or you will run into a small trumpet with obvious \"fried fish\", and your blood pressure will be instantly full.In terms of payment, the pass reward is quite conscientious. You can basically get the epic skin for free when playing tasks every week, but the mythical skin acquisition cycle is too long, and some new skin special effects are not as stunning as the first generation, which is a little disappointing.\n",
      "But we must praise Blizzard's update frequency. There are new maps and new modes every season, such as the recent \"Gladiator Field\" third-person limited-time gameplay. When fighting team battles from a different perspective, it actually feels different.When I was having sex with my friends, I shouted in my voice, \"I'll protect you\" and \"Genji, who is the Genji in the fire\", and the passion of this teamwork has not changed.If you like strategic shooting and teamwork and are willing to give the game some adaptation time, Overwatch ® 2 can still give you a lot of happiness - especially when you win a wonderful team battle with new routines, the sense of accomplishment is still very impressive.I hope that the matching mechanism can be optimized and optimized in the future, and this game will definitely go further.\n",

I have loved this game since before it came out, and one day i try to get on and i am logged out of my account. Ok. I scan the qr code and try to log into my battlenet account. Says the email is wrong. I try every email i have ever used in combination with every password i have ever known. I spend 3 days trying to figure this out. Nothing, I cant even get a support ticket with battlenet bc every time I try to open one it wants me to enter my email, and log into an account. Im not sure what to do about this, so I guess im just gonna stop playing the game. It was fun while it lasted but Blizzard's failure to provide any help at all has forced me to just up and quit. The new mode is neat, too bad im not gonna get to try out Freja in stadium.\n",

The game is so fun and stadium makes my brain go brr with all the endless possibilities it has to offer.

      "🌦️ Introduction\n",
      "I’ve been playing Overwatch since the original launched—sometime around mid-2017—and it gave me some of my most memorable multiplayer moments. I met great friends through it, even joined local tournaments for fun. Overwatch 2, though, is a different story. While it maintains the fast, fluid FPS gameplay I enjoy, it’s also wrapped in layers of missed opportunities, overpriced cosmetics, and an unfortunate turn away from its narrative roots.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overwatch 2 continues to look great. The hero designs remain top-tier, and the cosmetics are visually appealing—especially when you can actually see them. That’s why I’ve been enjoying the Stadium mode recently; switching to third-person makes showing off skins much more rewarding. That said, some skins are absurdly expensive, which feels off for a first-person shooter where you rarely see them.\n",
      "\n",
      "From a technical standpoint, the game still runs beautifully. The controls are responsive, the action is smooth, and the gameplay loop remains satisfying for FPS fans. However, long queue times—even in a free-to-play environment—are telling. Also, like most online multiplayer games, it suffers from toxic players and cheaters. While the game is still fun to play, the community experience can be hit or miss.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is where things fall apart. One of the biggest reasons fans were excited for Overwatch 2 was the promised PvE content that would expand the story and deepen the lore. Instead, we got scraps of what could’ve been, and those cinematic moments that once brought life to the Overwatch universe have all but vanished. Without the narrative drive, the game feels like it’s lost part of its identity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Audio design remains excellent. Every hero has a distinct voice, ability sound, and ultimate callout that enhances gameplay and immersion. The sound mix is polished and effective, making team fights feel intense and clear. Blizzard continues to do a great job on this front.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overwatch 2 is still mechanically strong and highly polished when it comes to moment-to-moment gameplay. But it’s also a shadow of what it promised to be. The abandoned PvE campaign, the steep cosmetic pricing, and an increasingly disjointed focus on collaborations over story progression have left long-time players like me disappointed. It’s still fun—especially in modes like Stadium—but it feels more like Overwatch 1.5 than a proper sequel.\n",

Overwatch 2 matchmaking is proof that Blizzard’s AI hates humanity. The only consistent thing about Overwatch 2 is the feeling of betrayal every time you queue up. It’s less of a hero shooter and more of a psychological experiment in how long players can endure unbalanced garbage before uninstalling.

Why would you match someone trying to return to your game after over a year with people actively playing ranked?

      "9492/12571 | 76561198256738342 → Overwatch 2 is less a sequel and more a cynical rebranding of a game that once had promise. Blizzard took everything fans loved about the original and either stripped it down, locked it behind paywalls, or drowned it in confusion. The \"2\" in the title feels like a joke — nothing here warrants a new number. It's more like Overwatch 1.1, if that. Let’s start with the most glaring insult: PvE. Promised as the flagship feature of OW2, it was marketed with fanfare, story-driven missions, progression systems — all scrapped. What we got instead is a watered-down version of co-op missions that feel like arcade mode filler. The full-blown PvE campaign that Blizzard teased for years? Vaporware. The shift to 5v5 ruined the balance, too. Tanks are now overly central, making matches feel lopsided depending on which team’s Reinhardt woke up feeling aggressive. Supports are either miserable or overpowered, and DPS feels like an afterthought. Instead of improving synergy, the role queue and balance patches often just create new problems while ignoring core issues. Then there’s monetization — the cherry on top of the dumpster fire. Blizzard gutted loot boxes (fine), but replaced them with overpriced skins and battle passes that give you a pathetic amount of content. Skins that were once fun to unlock through gameplay are now locked behind absurd paywalls. A $20 skin? In a free-to-play game that already ditched half its promises? Get lost. The user interface is cluttered, match queues are inconsistent, and matchmaking feels like a roulette wheel. You’re either steamrolling or getting steamrolled. Competitive mode? It’s a joke — no transparency, no real sense of progression, and no reason to suffer through it except sheer masochism.In short, Overwatch 2 isn’t a sequel — it’s a Frankenstein’s monster built from the corpse of the original game, held together by duct tape and microtransactions. If you loved Overwatch, this “sequel” is the biggest betrayal Blizzard could have given you.\n",

      "Blizzard once was among one of the most renowned and praised for their well known games such as Warcraft, Starcraft, Diablo and 2016 winner of the Game of the Year award , Overwatch.\n",
      "This game was truly something else back then. Similar in terms to the well acclaimed Team Fortress 2 which still has 50k active users to this day since its launch in 2007, Overwatch promised an original take on the hero based shooter genre, offering lots of characters to choose from with frequent updates adding new ones, an addicting game loop of progressing through the levels and gaining free cosmetics through lootboxes per level ( which were controversial at the time but it was still optional to buy them ), an imperfect but honestly good ranked gamemode. events which gave everyone a reason to come back, no matter if they played OW religiously or just wanted to try out a new experience and an extremely hyped competitive scene. This game was among the best you could get, despite of the fact that it was paid and Blizzard being Blizzard had quite atrocious monetization. This game peaked through 2016-2018 and hell, even in 2018-2021 it was still fun to play, albeit it was quite bland.\n",
      "BUT, ever since Blizzard updated the game to Overwatch 2, shutting down the original and after Jeffrey Kaplan had left Blizzard, it all went to crap. Monetization and the microtransactions became even more of a problem as you couldn't get as much stuff normally for free, the Battle Pass system creeping its way into the game as it was expected to, a promised campaign mode being cancelled not even a few months into its release with 3 fun, but ultimately forgettable missions, slow update releases, reskins and a whole, whole lot more problems that I won't even begin to talk about ( Employee accusations, predatory price tags, content that wasn't wanted by the community etc etc ).\n",
      "Yes, the game did receieve more QoL changes that made the game experience better ( not being forced to buy whole bundles for a skin, Mythic skins coming back ( but through prisms ), lootboxes making a return ) but ultimately, Blizzard has shown that it cares not for its devs and those who work and cherish their game, but for money, and lots of it, as all corporations do.\n",
      "I put around 200-300 hours into the initial game on the Playstation 4 and 219 hours on OW2 on PC as of the time I am writing this and I can confidently say this game was a waste of time, money and my nerves.\n",

Skins are way to overpriced, most of it is just fomo ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to take ur money as much as possible, riddled with cheaters especially in ranked an theirs just so many other minor things i can whine about the point of it all is that everythings adds up to an experience that yeah sure can be fun at times but causes frustration about just as equally the same amount of times as it brings u \"fun\" which is what games are supposed to be... an sometimes even when u do win a match u had to carry so hard or struggle so bad due to leavers, throwers, cheaters, people doing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and people not wanting to cooperate that at times winning the match doesnt even feel satisfying u just take a deep breath an feel like \"omg i won but wtf?!?\" so u cant even enjoy ur victories sometimes when u do get them an theirs a good number of days where you'll get on an you'll spend more time that day getting mad asf then u will having fun. An for me personally if a game pisses me off more then what i have \"fun\" on it then the game is probably just not good for me in general. an without going into greater details an making this extremely long just those surface lvl things are enough that i cant openly an confidently recommend this game to anyone much less my friends.\n",

      "9778/12571 | 76561198379681851 → wanted to update my review to point out things that have improved over the past seasons and point out some things that I think are being said that aren't true.\n",
      "Lets start with the good.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Gameplay changes\n",
      "these past few seasons there has been a shift in how the devs are changing the game-state. Perks got added which allow a lot more choice into the game with how the heroes can be played and they are still tweaking them and have stated they want to update some perks that are more numbers than actual gameplay altering choices. some great examples of this are things like Bastion shooting bombs which is great against groups but a lot worse on flyers or torb turret going on walls meaning you most often cant heal it but it can be very annoying.\n",
      "Stadium is also added which gives players a whole new gamemode to play around in that gives even more choice in how a hero can play. from mini bob spam to junkrat raining down bombs i find that over time Stadium can become a great gamemode as they add more heroes to roster.\n",
      "beyond the new they also added the option to play 6v6 in both quick play and comp which is great as someone who only enjoys tank in 6v6 im glad to see it coming back for good.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. lootboxes\n",
      "overall the only way Overwatch2 makes money is by the skins they sell and before there wasnt really a way to get any for free but now they have added back lootboxes you can get for free its become a lot better. I have gotten shop legendarys and a lot of Ow1 legendarys from them but overall im happy to have them back\n",
      "\n",
      "3.Comp\n",
      "Hero bans and map voting are amazing additions to comp and have made the overall feel of it a lot better. i never have to see sombra and genji in games anymore nor do i have to play clash or flashpoint, giving players more choice and agency in how they play the game is a very good way to keep them around\n",
      "\n",
      "Now some for some things i just want to add at the end\n",
      "1. the biggest change that sparked all of this good is Microsoft's buyout of blizzard and in tandem the removal of Bobby Kotick from blizzard, while we couldn't see the changes right away it feels like night and day from when Bobby Kotick was in control to now. Devs listen and respond more, more shakeups to gameplay happen and good comp changes are put into place. while yes the monetisation is still pretty bad its going in the right direction with lootboxes.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.PvE\n",
      "the PvE content is bad downright awful but if people are still mad about it in big 2025 I ask you get over it. the devs have conformed that they arent working on it anymore and are going full in on trying to make the gameplay better which in the end is the better thing to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.Toxic teammates\n",
      "this will always be a problem, hackers will always be a problem, smurffing will always be a problem and that is something everyone should expect when playing an online game, its the sad truth. could the game do more to fix yea but they have already gone after ximming and made it a permaban if you're caught.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the end Overwatch 2 is a game that while not the best is a lot better than what it was in 2024. screw what Bobby Kotick did but the bogyman is not in blizzard anymore\n",

      "\n",
      "First, the good parts :\n",
      "- The lore is cool, the characters have a story which is related to another story which is cool and makes a connection between all the characters.\n",
      "- Characters are well designed, doesn't really need a skin for each one\n",
      "- Maps are well designed, good atmosphere and settings\n",
      "- Lootbox are back, why not\n",
      "- Gamemode are simple but they aren't that bad\n",
      "- Personalised games are kinda cool, why not, but only for some hours\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, bad parts :\n",
      "- The worst part of Overwatch is community, and what Blizzard do to them : You know, this teamates who decide to afk mid-game because he haven't a mercy on his ass, or saying \"Yeah, team diff\", \"I'm not playing because of the thrower\", \"{put rôle here} diff\". Also we can add teamates who just rush and say \"Yeah I don't have any heal\". And, you must be wondering \"What Blizzard is doing against them ?\". Well, nothing. Nobody's getting banned, they just have some days to wait and play again. Oh, they can loose reputation, OMG, you know, this system ♥♥♥♥♥♥ up and that nobody's give a ♥♥♥♥ because people who have a reputation level of 5 are mostly bad randoms.\n",
      "- The economy. 2nd worst part of the game. The game is here to make you spend as much money as possible : Do you want a battlepass ? All your economy will be gone. And moreover, you'll need to wait 1 battlepass to be able to buy one again. Also, skin are overpriced, even bundles, who wants to spend 40€ for 3 skin and a Twix (yeah because nothing is interresting except the skin)\n",
      "- Characters. Well written, even if it's not incredible, but so many of them are just broken. Freya who can just deal so must damage in one arrow, dash in any direction 4 times, bastion who makes you feel like you were in a no man's land in WW2 when boosted (or not) by a mercy, Juno who's just the most annoying support you can find on the game, Zarya who deal too much damages when at 100 energy (yeah because bad randoms will shoot at her bubbles), Sombras who can grab a kill easily and get back like nothing... There's too much to say, too many reworks to do, to many balance to do. I feel like when it comes to release a new character, Blizzard sleep the whole time and just release him at the last minute without trying it.\n",
      "- Maps. Even if they're well designed, good settings and all, these maps are most of the time side diff.\n",
      "- Abandoned project or things that Blizzard don't want to do at 100%. PvE which was kind of great has been abandonned, Mastery parkour who have only a few character, Stadium who only let you play a little amount of the characters... You have 2 whole month to release a new gamemode and finished, and you can't do that. They are good idea which will surely attract some players, but you choose to release the start of the project. When will we have a finished new gamemode ?\n",
      "- Push and the other one that annoy every one gamemodes. Not bad idea, but surely not finished and tried before. It's not really fun to know that only one error can you make you loose the robot, and after the game, or on the points that you have to take (point A to E)\n",
      "- Logic in general. Why does Stadium (which have only a few characters) is a rankled mode ? Why can't I recommand someone in this mode ? Why is the only mode which doesn't let you change character ? Do it to every single modes (except in arcade and personalised games, obviously) !\n",
      "- Matchmaking. I hate it so much. You're waiting for 15 whole minutes, you will be like \"Oh finaly, a new game !\" And someone will just left the game, or you'll have a new player with you even if you have 500hours on the game, or you'll have this bad random who's toxic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, needs improvement. Even if I know that Blizzard doesn't wants to listen to their community (or only after the arrival of a pvp hero game), I hope they'll listen to us like they've done by the past\n",

      "\n",
      "It would be easy to write a review slandering Overwatch and its developers. Trust me. Truthfully I don't think that will be helpful to anyone (Though some I've read are very funny).\n",
      "Overwatch 2 Is a game. A good game? no. A bad game? no. It is in my eyes the perfect amount of... meh.\n",
      "\n",
      "For every cool new hero, every interesting map, you see pitfalls in other aspects of the game. The lack of focus on lore (I'm aware of the comics and videos but this is a review on the game), the obvious money focused outlook when it comes to giving heroes new skins ( Can't wait for the 10 millionth Kiriko skin) to the questionable \"Micro\" transactions that are seemingly discounted? (Surely discounting an item before having it out at normal price is fraudulent right?).\n",
      "\n",
      "The gameplay is aggravating when you lose, and aggravating when you win. But I must admit, there is that addictive aspect about it that makes me always queue up for another round. Is that a good thing? not really. But I enjoy playing games with my friends and Fiance, and OW2 does the job.\n",
      "\n",
      "I repeat my previous statement. It is a game...\n",
      "\n",
      "Play it for yourself (It's free why not) and you'll probably find you enjoy yourself, at least to some degree. Though it is by no means an AMAZING game.\n",
      "10029/12571 | 76561199838474844 → Ahem where to start, let's talk about the company of the American Blizzard.\n",
      "Well, let's say this company is famous for the fact that they have a very good safety on the site, but as the people say good security spoils the reputation and mood.\n",
      "After registering an account on Battle.net, I found that, you won’t go into the game, but it won’t let you in because the mobile authenticator on the phone does not open the browser after the button to continue, okay with it, I went the other, but even he didn’t help, because it is made up the number, you don’t bind the number, let you have an account of Kazakhstan or you have an account Kazakhstan orAmerican, this will not work out your number will always start with 7 always by default and do not change it.\n",
      "And if you introduce the Russian number to write in the system the error that they say, including Kazakhstan, so well oxy and how then to play?, And I will tell you no-ka-k\n",
      "From the word in general, did you think about VPN?Do not worry, VPN will not help here, even VPN will not go to their system, so I do not recommend this game, from the word this game starting from 05/14/2025 in the black list of Steam games from Blizzard\n",

      "10421/12571 | 76561198349921505 → Uuuuuuhh what to say... I'll break it down by role I guess.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tank:\n",
      "Honestly this game is never going to recover from removing 2 tanks for a 6v6 mode. The result is one role has an unfair amount of pressure to perform compared to the rest of the team. A bad dps or support won't ruin your game but a tank doing badly is a game ends it for everyone. I'm going to knock every roll for counterwatch brainrot but I'll only mention it once here where its the most egregious. Requiring that someone even slightly willing to play the tank role has to master three or more characters and be able to swap on a dime is too high a bar for a lot of casual players. Punishing swapping characters doesn't solve this problem either if the initial matchup is the unfair one, thus why Stadium is such a gamble.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dps:\n",
      "The most fun role that everyone queues for! So don't expect to ever be this if you don't pick it exclusively. I think that there are balance issues with a lot of individual characters when it comes to their movement abilities (looking at Sombra, Mercy, Doomfist, Pharah, Hammond if he were useful) and issues where damage output is too high (Freja). Blizzard doesn't like to remove abilities once they've solidified themselves in the game so don't cross your fingers on them ever balancing the outlier you happen to hate (don't worry you'll find one).\n",
      "\n",
      "Support:\n",
      "If you main this just go play Marvel Rivals, the difference is night and day and you'll be rewarded much more for your skillset. Swapping back to this game I never realised just how sluggish healing is but the legitimate pain I feel when I can't save a tank in this game that would have survived in the other will pain me evermore. I didn't bother to mention it for dps but for support if the other one isn't carrying their weight in heals you're in for an incredibly painful game. You don't believe that dps supports actually exist until they're on your team with 200 more damage than you for a quarter of your healing insisting that its the dps's fault not their inability to position anywhere but directly in front of their tank.\n",

That being said, it's still one of the best multiplayer experiences out there today. The devs have been busting their asses to make it better and season 16 shows that more than any other so far. Stadium is a very fun gamemode and very much feels like Overwatch 2.5. It takes a little time to learn all the characters but once you have a firm grasp on 2 or 3 of them it is a great game.

With the rewarding mechanics of the game actually already made, new characters, and such once they actually started giving a ♥♥♥♥ they made a bunch of cool changes and gave Overwatch a cool new identity with the new Stadium Mode and perk system. 10/10 currently, just beware this game will kill itself if marvel rivals ever dies.\n",

The minute she dropped, Blizzard rearrange the other characters' ages to some inconsistency (Yes, the time line doesn't make sense in the past, but it got worse now). Worse is that I heard that Blizzard does this with their other games (like some of the \"WoW\"). The major reasons why is that Blizzard laid off the main studios and lore employees that are responsible for the greatness of the OG movies and comics. (The mild example is Juno's trailer, which is a waterdown version of Mei's).\n",

I stopped playing because it was too repetitive.I went back to play this year and I find that now many maps that existed before they do not appear or rarely appear (eg Volskaya industries, Anubis Temple, etc ...);The most appearing game modes are advance and flashpoint (a dry authentic), the most fun and the escort and hybrid;And lastly, the toxicity of the community that is worse than many games (I will not name names), full of kids who only cry, people who play support but attack as if they were DPS and do not heal anyone from the team.Anyway, Overwatch if you want to go back to what it was before you need to work hard more, for example to bring old events and if possible new ones.But I have to congratulate you for finally bringing the loot box's back and the incredible stadium.\n",

      "\n",
      "I never played OW during 2016, I started playing in 2019. I know there are some people that only played the game during the early days, and they don't like how the game has become a competitive game, and I understand but strongly disagree. From talking with my friends that played the game in the early days, it was less toxic, but that was more because the game was so fresh, nobody knew what was going on at the time, and everyone was just having fun with this new game. I played OW classic, but to be honest, it sucked. It leaned into the mechanics that in the hands of a skilled player are just awful to play into. Overall it was fun to play the original mode, but I am glad I didn't play the game originally in that state.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I started, role queue was already the primary mode, and I do think that role lock took it too far. It did solve to problem of having 4 insta-lock DPS that refuse to switch and just end up throwing the game, but it introduced long queue times across the game. It wasn't just a high rank problem, but it affected everyone, and still does. Even in the current game, the 6v6 open queue mode will have 1-2 minute queues at MOST for mid ranks, while a 5 minute queue is fairly standard for the same ranks in role queue.\n",
      "\n",
      "In hindsight, the switch to 5v5 is the biggest blunder of OW. It is an understandable switch, it helps with the queue time problems, but the imbalance ended up forcing the balance team to power creep supports, and they either had to choose between tanks being server admins, or completely useless. Even when tanks were strong, that didn't mean they were fun to play, the power of your pick would force the enemy team to pick heros that had a good matchup into you. If you picked Winston, expect a D.Va Reaper Bastion to roll out of spawn the next fight. If you swap D.Va, expect beams. Whatever you play, provided you were not completely terrible at it, expect the entire enemy team to swap something that has a good matchup into you. This is not really fun for anyone involved in the process. Regardless of the character and role you wanted to play, chances are not swapping will end up with you losing the game, just because you had a bad matchup. The real problem with this is that it was so easy, you could train a dog to counterswap. You see the monkey, you swap reaper, and win, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why do I think the game is going in the right direction?\n",
      "\n",
      "The introduction on the open queue 6v6 mode. Most of the problems with 5v5 are solved just by the format switch. The supports are still a little bit stronger than they should be, but it isn't by that much.With 2 tanks, counterswapping is much harder too. You can see a Winston and swap Bastion, because you have a good matchup into him, but they also have a D.Va who removes the bulk of your value if played right. This makes the game much more about how well you play the character compared to what character you play.\n",
      "\n",
      "What I still think could be improved:\n",
      "1) Revert the global ult charge nerf coming into OW2 (for those who don't remember, they made every ult more expensive at the start of the game)\n",
      "2) Fix the matchmaker, there is no reason for most games to have a 7 division gap. You shouldn't have Silvers in a Platinum game, or GM players in a Diamond lobby. I see spreads like this consistently, and all it does is foster toxicity. In any rank, you expect a certain level of gameplay, and having a player on your team who can't live up to that leads to them getting flamed 9/10 times, even though it isn't really their fault. Who really expects a Gold player to be able to perform in a Diamond lobby?\n",
      "3) Bring the overall support powerlevel down. 3 supports is the meta for a reason...\n",
      "4) Consider removing the scoreboard, as I find that it just gives people more reason to be toxic to their team.\n",
      "5) Bring back the end of game cards from the first game!\n",

It came to a point where I do find other multiplayer even more boring cuz they don't have the same stimulation that Overwatch do, here there's not a single moment where you would just sit still or wait for almost anything, to the point that people on the community hates it if there's a character that is able to just stand there and somehow live.\n",

Heroes are released in half-baked states, and players are left reeling with constant meta shifts. It’s hard to build consistency when you're getting whiplash every patch.\n",
      "\n",
      "Power creep is also a looming issue. As newer heroes are introduced, they often overshadow legacy ones, making it tough to maintain long-term cohesion in the roster. The game’s original design had charm, focus, and balance—it felt like a competitive sport. Now, it leans more toward chaos, especially after moving away from the original 6v6 format. That change alone drastically altered the pacing. What was once a tactical, thoughtful shooter now feels more like a rapid-respawn free-for-all where you die every ten seconds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, it’s not all doom and gloom. This game has incredible longevity for a reason. The hero designs—especially in the early years—are iconic, and the attention to visual detail remains second to none. Even now, the game runs like a dream. It’s smoother, more polished, and more visually stunning than any other hero shooter out there.\n",
      "\n",
      "I miss the version of this game that focused on coordination, team dynamics, and methodical play. I still love competitive games for the adrenaline rush and the camaraderie—minus the occasional toxic man-baby teammates, of course. But while the soul of the original game might be fading, its technical excellence and creative spark still shine.\n",

      "That said I really feel that Overwatch is in a very healthy time, I returned after a long time because some friends told me about playing, I am a player from Overwatch 1 As I said before, the truth that at first was not convinced that they had practically removed all the Stunns of the game for the problems with these of the previous installOf legends in which a Stun does not mean so much since a game usually goes about 30 to 50 minutes or more, in Overwatch it ended up being a considerable time of your departure.As Main Mei was considerably affected by this but I understood that it was for the health of the game, it seemed good to me as they solved it and as finally after so long they managed to balance the game quite a lot, I liked what they did with the Perks system, since although those are not usually the best, they added ancient abilities of the heroes as Perks, which is even beautiful for the nostalgic ones like me.\n",
      "In addition, the stadium mode seemed an incredible addition to the game, since the problem of many players is that they do not know how to do counterpick or simply know how to play one or two heroes, removing all that complexity but not leaving the game empty or flat thanks to the implement of the item purchase system that gives a lot of variety to the game and adding complexity in exchange for the one that was subtracted.\n",
      "Finally it seems to me that this game has a lot to make its similarity to the first game, it is true that it is literally the same game with a small face washing, but that they expected, if it had been differentThat in conclusion I feel that the game is at a very good time and that the studio is finally worrying even if it is a little about it, it may be that I am used to the previous delivery that when they did not know how to balance the game they simply did not do it and abandoned it but well\n",

      "Overwatch 2, in its current state, is a decent game. The core gameplay is still fun, the hero designs remain unique, and the action can be just as exciting as it once was. But there’s no denying that since the release of Overwatch 2, Blizzard has clearly shifted its focus toward monetization rather than passion-driven development.\n",

      "When OW2 launched, we were promised big things—a PvE mode, meaningful updates, a renewed direction. Sadly, many of those promises are now just distant echoes.

      "Despite all of that, I still can’t bring myself to leave a negative review. There’s too much nostalgia tied to this game. Overwatch defined an era for me, and it still carries that emotional weight. And when I hop into a game as Reaper, it reminds me why I fell in love with it in the first place. His aggressive, flanking playstyle is insanely fun, and nothing beats a well-timed Death Blossom. Tracer comes in a close second for me—she’s fast, chaotic, and rewards mechanical skill like no other.\n",

      "\n",
      "Right now, I’d say the game is in a poor-to-decent state. There’s still hope, but it’ll take real effort from Blizzard to bring Overwatch back to even a stable place—not even aiming for former glory, just survival. I truly hope they step up. This game deserves better.\n",

      "- Competitions are a separate song - they throw parasites in Tim that play 3 orders of magnitude worse than anyone else and do not let him tell him something, you can never get out of gold without Tima from Skill.In the stadium on the diamond there are whole Tims of Olukhs who cannot do frag and they are presented and banned because they have more votes of complaints.\n",
      "- Blizard directly hates old heroes such as Farra - neither skins nor stadium, but they add new garbage.Some new shit heroes such as an echo - which flies and bullets in all or DD excitement instead of a tank, tanks that play DD, and not tank and this is encouraged, although everyone loses because of this is proud, stats are the best.Skill is not valued, you just need to be silent or skib your asses.\n",

      "I played a good amount of both Marvel Rivals and Overwatch now. Overwatch has characters that are fun to play and provide unique play styles that can fit a wide range of players, and it does it perfectly. My first 10 hours was pretty fun. My friends invited me to play and we had a blast. After some experience, I just couldn't enjoy the game anymore because the game struggles to let you play the character you want, instead give you homework to counter pick an enemy. You don't want to play this character, but you NEED to.\n",

      "Overwatch 2 brings everything you'd expect from a high-caliber hero shooter: faster pacing, sleek visuals, tighter 5v5 combat, and a roster full of vibrant personalities. But let’s be honest—none of it hits quite like Junker Queen.\n",
      "\n",
      "She’s more than a hero. She’s a storm in human form—all muscle, metal, and magnetism. When she enters the fight, it’s like the rest of the game steps aside to let her own the moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Game Is Great—But She’s a Force of Nature\n",
      "Yes, the gunplay is crisp. Yes, the new heroes are cool. But Junker Queen? She’s something else. She doesn’t just tank damage—she steals focus. Whether she’s revving up for her ult or standing tall in a victory pose, she exudes presence. Commanding, raw, seductive presence.\n",
      "\n",
      "And it’s not just her voice (which is deep, gritty, and full of bite). It’s the way she moves. The way she wears her power. The way her body carries story, strength, and unapologetic dominance all at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "Power in Every Step\n",
      "Junker Queen’s design isn’t subtle—it’s deliberate. From her shredded arms to her inked shoulders, her body is all sharp angles and fierce lines. Strong legs, lean frame, thick thighs that look like they could snap you in two—every part of her broadcasts control.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her boots slam the ground with a kind of beautiful finality. There’s a rhythm to it. A weight. A subtle challenge. Every step says: watch me—or get out of my way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her posture tells you she knows she’s being watched—and she leans into it. Her low-cut gear reveals just enough to draw your eyes, while her confident stance dares you to keep them there. She’s not playing cute. She’s playing dominant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her Body Is a Weapon—and It Shows\n",
      "You don’t just admire Junker Queen. You feel her. The way her torso twists during her axe swing. The coiled power in her arms. The smooth, deadly grace in her ult’s charge. She’s built for battle, but there’s an undeniable heat in the way she handles it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing about her is accidental. The belts that hug her hips. The way her abs flash between her gear. Even the boots—heavy, imposing, undeniably provocative in how they anchor her down—feel like part of the fantasy. She’s not just strong. She’s irresistibly dangerous.\n",
      "\n",
      "Final Verdict: Long Live the Queen\n",
      "Overwatch 2 delivers on its promise: it’s fast, fresh, and filled with big moments. But Junker Queen? She’s the moment. She’s the reason you pause during character select. The reason you stare a little too long at the kill cam. The reason victory screens suddenly feel personal.\n",
      "\n",
      "She’s power, attitude, and allure wrapped in a battle-scarred body—and she knows exactly what she’s doing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Final Score: 10/10 — For the Queen, we fight. For the Queen, we fall.\n",
      "\n",
      "P.S.\n",
      "There’s something mesmerizing about the raw, physical detail of her body—especially the cut of her abs, flexing with each breath like a sculpted war machine. And her feet, framed in rugged, worn-in boots, somehow steal attention too—firm, grounded, and unmistakably real. There’s a kind of curved grace in the way she plants them, like every stance is a portrait of strength. Not just functional—feral, striking, unforgettable.\n",

      "\n",
      "As someone who experienced the hype of the launch and the height of the first game, I can say, with conviction, that the current state of Overwatch 2 is comparable to the \"golden years\" of Overwatch 1. It is undeniable that the release of Overwatch 2 was disastrous, with Blizzard breaking promises and introducing changes that made the game objectively worse.The community's frustration was more than justified.But today's game is different.Developers not only reversed controversial decisions, but also added content that rescues the essence of the game.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of the aspects I would like to stand out from the current state of the game:\n",
      "- New characters are frequently launched and automatically unlocked;\n",
      "- 6v6 mode is back, casually and competitively;\n",
      "- The launch of the small skills that change the gameplay of each character;\n",
      "- Character banning system in ranked matches;\n",
      "- Reintroduction of \"Loot Boxes\", only this time completely free;\n",
      "- Launch of Stadium mode, which is basically an MOBA version of Overwatch.\n",

      "\n",
      "Pros who liked Overwatch 1 and were disillusioned with the release of the second game, I strongly recommend that they give a second chance.And for those who have never played overwatch and are interested, or at least they want to compare with Marvel Rivals, I can say that this is the best possible time to start playing Overwatch 2.\n",

However, I advise everybody to never spend any money on this game. Just got perma banned for no reason after not even getting a single temporary ban throughout my 9 years playing this game. Reason? I ♥♥♥♥ on some low elo players on a new gamemode they added that starts everybody out at the lowest rank without any form of placement match and got accused (and falsely convicted) of cheating. If going 45/3 against a bunch of bronze pisslows is proof of cheating, enough so that they perma ban without notice and uphold the ban upon being sent a ticket, then anybody that is remotely decent at the game is at risk of getting banned without further investigation at any point. Their automatic banning system is heavily flawed, and Blizzard surely knows this. Popular streamers such as Kenzo, as well as certain OWL players have been falsely banned, and their bans were swiftly lifted because they are well known. But, what does this say about their trigger happy auto ban system, as well as the hundreds of other players that get banned that don't get the same treatment as famous streamers and pro players? At least according to reddit, if you get falsely banned, you will have to contact support over and over again for anywhere from 3 months to half a year (if ever) before they get a human employee to check your account, taking anywhere from 30-50 tickets before anybody actually checks the situation and takes action. As for me, I'm on my third bot response saying the same copy paste answer about how my ban will not get lifted, with a link to their code of conduct page. Absolutely disgusting company.\n",

Aaron Keller and the development team have opened a continuous communication channel with the community, taking feedback on many requested features like free lootboxes and 6v6. All while continuing to try and make a good game aside from requests, the launch of stadium has easily shown that more than anything else in season 16.

There wasn't really anything that could justify calling it \"Overwatch 2\" before then, even factoring in the new heroes and maps added over time. Now, however, I finally believe the game fits the name. It shouldn't have taken as long as it did, but still.\n",

      "- Perks add an interesting layer of decision making to the game. Do I stick with the hero I leveled up to tier 3 or do I counter swap and try to level a new hero quickly in that round? Do I use a perk to increase self-sustain or do I pick one to increase my utility? This is legit a new core mechanic that separates it a good deal from OW1.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Stadium essentially takes the concept of perks and goes all in with a MOBA inspired perk/power-up system in a Best-of-7 burst round mode. Earn cash through the round to buy perks to change your character's stats and add unique properties to your character's kit that you otherwise wouldn't see in the core mode. With generic stat modifiers and unique power-ups that turn your character into a brand new one, this mode REALLY sets OW2 apart from OW1. The only downside is that only 17 characters are available in Stadium atm, but they plan to add the rest of the cast overtime. There's a lot to learn with each character tho, so it'll for sure keep people busy til then.\n",

      "- 6v6 returns in an open-queue format with a two-tank limit per team. Normal role-lock 5v5 is still there, this just replaces the 5v5 open-queue (that was honestly not very fun to play). The return of 6v6 adds that classic feel of team comp flexibility while also letting you choose how to best support your team where you think they're lacking. It's not for everybody, but it's nice to have the option, imo.\n",

      "I originally bought overwatch (1) which then transitioned into requiring a account which i didn't bother it with version 2 and free to play i thought it was the perfect time to play again.

      "When i returned to the game and had to que for a role i was sceptical.

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "As such i would give it a 8.5/10 \"Fun and simple hero shooter\"\n",
      "However the reason i will give it a negative review is cause i feel really scammed for having bought the first game and now just being told that buying the first game has no value whatsoever and my money magically evaporated. \"Oh but you didn't lose everything! You still have your skins that you obtained during Overwatch 1! which if you didn't grind up for the legendary skins they are literally free to get. And don't worry about the coins you got from paid lootboxes! They got converted into our free currency!!!\"\n",
      "We should not tolerate the fact that companies can say that the 60 euro's you spent on a game has no more value. I know Overwatch 1 is like extremely old and 2 was this supposed to be massive update. But over that time 60 euro's is still 60 euro's it hasn't magically disappeared. And even the thing that made overwatch 2 big (The campaign) isn't even being developed anymore so the thing that everyone got scammed for isn't even actively being developed anymore compared to destiny2 where they ATLEAST they added new content while scamming people.\n",

You could savor the taste, skip the unwanted dishes, and go straight for the goodies. The second visit was entirely different, however. The restaurant looked the same, but they never replaced empty dishes, so when someone took the finely-cooked steak, you couldn't get that; instead, you were forced to eat unseasoned rutabagas. On top of that, customer service was awful. If you complimented the food, you would be kicked out of the restaurant. And with that, a lot of original goers, such as myself, never came back.

      "I would recommend you at least try the game in training, try out some heroes, try quick play (even better if you have some friends) and waste a few hours trying to find one or two classes you like. Then you can try to spend another few hours practising those classes and see how you develop. Even if you're into more oldschool shooters, the mechanics are most definitely there and you won't find anything as satisfying in the game as escaping a really nasty situation, carrying the team through a tough spot, or sensing an opportuninty and going hard to finish off your nemesis for the game.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's different compared to Quake, Doom (1993), and Unreal Tournament, which I would say are the closest, as the roleplaying elements and classes bring a new kind of emergent complexity into the game, but considering how solid the core gameplay is (just as in Apex Legends) I would definitely recommend it even for fans of hardcore oldschool arena shooters. Don't whack it, not this one. It's also good for the whole family.\n",

Anyone who complained about the double shield meta then said the start of ow2 wasn't just as bad are lying to themselves, NO ONE had fun seeing a mercy pocketed Soj shoot their tank for two seconds then disintegrate when she right clicks on you from across the map.. I miss the days when games were about FUN and the competitive aspects came second or were kept separate.. thats why Rivals was successful even after the honeymoon phase BECAUSE the devs balanced around fun first.

Remember when Blizzard tried to sell us on this \"sequel\" with promises of exciting new heroes and a ground-breaking PvE experience? Yeah, about that — turns out what really kept us logging in wasn't the \"new heroes\" (spoiler alert: they aren't that special) but the faint, dying hope that maybe, just maybe, the devs would remember what made the original fun before greedy daddy Activision — and now even greedier daddy Microsoft — swooped in to milk it dry.\n",
