Maps are super small for modern vehicles, and anti-air vehicles are incapable of keeping ground battles from becoming \"who can spawncamp the most with aircraft from 10 miles away\". Balance wise, you often face 1980s technology with 1940s technology, with all the disadvantages/advantages that entails depending on the nation you play. It's also a waste of time, because despite having literally hundreds of vehicles available to play, 99% of them are locked behind a wall of \"research\". You're lucky to get 2/3s of the way through one nation's ground vehicle tree, in a 1000 hours of play. If a game sucks half a month of your life away without giving you something new, it's not worth it. Half of the premiums are useless as well. Not only that, but when (declassified) information is forwarded to the devs that proves certain models and functions of the game and its vehicles incorrect, they usually ignore it.

How to cook crumbs of pork pork in a pan on the stove?First, prepare the necessary ingredients.For pilaf, pork pulp without bones is usually used.It can be a ham, neck, spatula.I have a ham.Step 2. Rinse pork, dry and cut in medium pieces.Step 3. Rick carefully rinse to pure transparent water.It is best to use special steamed polished rice for pilaf.It is not boiled and preserves the shape well.Step 4. Peel the carrots and cut into small strips.Step 5. Peel the bow.Typically, the onion is added to the pilaf in the form chopped with small cubes.I usually add the whole onion, but at the very end I throw it out.Step 6. In a pot with a thick bottom, heat the vegetable oil.Put the pork and fry over high heat until a golden golden crust.If you have a small pan, it is better to fry the pork in several visits so that less moisture stands out of it.A frying over high heat will help seal all meat juices inside the pieces and pork will remain juiciness.Step 7. Pour spices and salt into the meat and mix quickly.For pilaf, it is advisable not to use enameled dishes - in it meat and spices can burn and boast to the bottom.And when trying to clean the bottom, you can damage the enamel.Better take stainless steel pots or anti -stick coating.Step 8. Put the carrots to the meat and fry, stirring, over medium heat for 2-3 minutes.If you want to add the onion in chopped form, it must be added at this stage with carrots.Step 9. Pour a glass of boiling water into the meat, add a whole onion if you have not been added in a crushed form before that, and bay leaf.Step 10. Cover the pan with a lid and simmer over low heat for 20 minutes until the softness of the meat and evaporate most of the liquid.Step 11. Pour the washed rice on top of the meat and flatter.In this case, the rice should remain on top.It is not necessary to mix with meat.Step 12. Pour the meat and rice with hot water so that the rice is completely covered with a liquid of 1 cm. It takes about one and a half glasses water.It is important that there is not too much water, because in this case it will have to evaporate longer, and rice can boil and lose shape.Step 13. Again, cover the pan with a lid and simmer over low heat until the liquid is evaporated for about 25-30 minutes.At this time, do not mix the rice.Step 14. Mix the finished rice with meat.Put the cloves of garlic on top.Step 15. Again, cover the pan with a lid and let the pilaf brew for another 15 minutes.Bon appetit!\n",

Until the inevitable happens: the snail begins to suck your money.More and more .. congratulations!You arrived at Top Tier - but it's the Premium Tier Tier.You don't know how to play.Realizes that it is not the same as low tier.It is completely lost and frustrated.After about 500h of game, you already know the basics - and probably decided to play with the aircraft during that time.And follows the same line: fun until the arrival of the radars, and especially the Fox-3.You realize that it is no use flying loudly or low.If you do not know how to turn to the side and let go of Chaff .. death.When finally arrives at the True Tier of Tanks, he realizes that the tank is no longer ahead.This will only lead you to death.You need to know exactly where to shoot the enemy for him to die - instead of receiving a \"ricochet\" and then a shot in the face.Summing up everything: if you'll start playing - or started - stop while you can.Or you will waste hours of your life, a lot of money and sanity.That said: Note: 10/10.0 Defects.Amazing game.And as everyone already knows, \"A life without War Thunder is not a life worth living.\"Greet the snail.\n",

Lets start with the positives: - Incredible vehicles, the details on each vehicle is incredible, especially on something like the ships - Gameplay itself is rather fun usually, as there is a certain satisfaction in blowing up a vehicle and capturing points to make a team win. - The maps have plenty of detail and usually can fit the playstyle of each player, whether you like close quarters or long range. However there is the negatives. - The players is a massive problem. In the fact that whenever a teammate actually goes to help you, is rare. And many, many other things. Teamplay is NOT a thing in this game, even though it is required. It is more of an every man for himself game - I don't wanna say this, but there is russian bias in this game. And I have played a good bit of the aircraft and tanks, there is just some of those tanks that truly shine and is not affected. I need to point out that there is certain vehicles in other nations that has the same, but mainly I see the vehicles in the USSR tech tree. - There is a lack of game modes. As fun as it is to go and get a point and defend it. It does get rather boring after a while. There is a lot of people that has the Stockholm syndrome to this game I may be one of them. But I will say this. If you think about playing it, simply don't. Your mind and wallet will thank you for it\n",

Gameplay and technology almost all the time - this is a dull grind.Of the dozen cars are really interesting - units, the rest are either useless or boring.There is no balance in battles: the technique of the 70s fights with tanks of the 50s, while the priorities in the matchmaking match are unclear.Mechanics ± 1 BR - does not solve the problem, only enhances the feeling of chaos.2. Aviation and helicopters if you want to play by helicopters or planes - get ready to suffer.Helicopters are easily knocked down by anti -aircraft guns, which are many times cheaper.Airoproken - torment: either go to the simulator and a hollow base with bombs, or in realistic battles, where experience drips like water from a tap.3. Mechanics, bugs, training mechanic - the sea, but understand for yourself.There is almost no training.Old bugs are not corrected, but new events with bugs regularly sculpt.The fleet is half -dead, there are almost no players.4. Impressions and conclusion rare battles are interesting, but their drop in the sea of ​​dull routine.Without donat - pumping is long and tiring.Camouflages delight, but this does not save.The game turns into a \"pumping service\", and not an interesting military action.Conclusion: War Thunder is gradually dying.I spent a lot of time - I regret it.If you value yours, do not start.The game is not worth the effort.\n",

      "80/4320 | nan → I adore this game so much but the reason it has bad reviews is Gajins own fault they make players playing newer age vehicles have to grind actual years worth of hours. Personally i don't even like playing high end combat, all the real fun is dealing with the issues of the WW1 and 2 vehicles. Modern combat is so much more complicated it has a completely different player base which is why its dumb that people who want to race jets have to grind years in order to play their game. For me though this War thunder has always been perfect because i actually want to play at lower levels and thus never been an issue. Just wish Gajin would be kinder to the people who WANT to play their game like they put so much effort into making realistic modern vehicles but the majority of the player base will simply never get to that point to play with them making high tier player bases very small and only the most committed players\n",

      "85/4320 | nan → In my opinion, this game of update is becoming increasingly unplayable, features that have been inside some updates do not work properly, the maps are grotty, so that one spawn can shoot in the other but not the other way around.Organization or bad one of the most toxic community I have ever experienced, here the Ellenbogen Society is properly lived out, Team Play = 0.Gaijin only takes care of one new premium vehicles that now cost 79.99.The rest is either a little or not at all.Events are designed in such a way that as a working person you either have to completely sacrifice your rest of your free time or since Gaijin is interested in our best your money.Server are good and evil beyond.Especially noticeable in the early hours when you play the Far East.Own bullets disappear are not recognized by the server.

      "90/4320 | 76561199380604679 → ABRBSBGaijin Gaijin To all the players of War Thunder:I believe everyone has noticed the recent changes in the in-game economy, whether it's for naval, ground, air battles, AB, RB, or SB. Gaijin is continuously pushing the boundaries and testing the limits of its players. If you are familiar with the game \"Escape from Tarkov,\" you probably know the consequences when game developers constantly provoke their player base. As players of this game, we contribute to its activity, and in theory, Gaijin should appreciate each and every one of us who continues to support and encourage this game. However, Gaijin keeps pushing the boundaries and exploiting each and every one of us. This recent economic change is not just a simple adjustment, Gaijin is gradually making it clear that if you don't pay for this game, you don't deserve to play it.I implore every player here to bravely stand up and resist this behavior. Gaijin has now infringed upon our rights as players, and we cannot, and should not, let Gaijin continue to exploit us in the future. It is time for us players to unite and stand together. We should be a collective, a class, opposing Gaijin's exploitation and oppression towards us. We are here to enjoy this game, to find joy in it, and we should not be working for Gaijin.1 hope that each player will save and spread this message.

      "143/4320 | nan → War Thunder isn’t just your run-of-the-mill shooty game, it’s like they crammed an entire military museum into your PC and then dared you to survive inside it. The realism is almost rude. You’re not just flying a plane or rolling a tank; you’re basically signing up for a crash course in “why your grandfather’s back still hurts.” Right from the jump, you know you’re in deep. Arcade? Sure, if you want to ease in and not have a panic attack. But the real meat is when you crank the realism up, yank off the training wheels, and suddenly you’re sweating over the oil pressure gauge because, yeah, your engine can just die on you now. If you’re new, there’s a ladder, more like a cliff, waiting for you after the tutorial. The content? It’s ridiculous. Hundreds of vehicles, all the way from biplanes that look like they’d fall apart in a strong breeze, up to jet fighters and modern tanks that could probably flatten your whole street. Every little thing matters: ammo types, armor thickness, where your poor little crew sits inside the tank (spoiler: they’re gonna have a bad day if you get hit in the wrong spot). Forget health bars, one lucky shot and boom, you’re a smoldering wreck. Combat is wild, sometimes absolutely bonkers. Dogfights are sweaty-palmed chaos, tank battles feel like chess matches where every pawn is a sledgehammer, and when all the different forces get mashed together? It’s a glorious mess. Sometimes you’re the hero. Sometimes you’re a flaming crater in the dirt. That’s life. But listen, if you’re looking for something chill, keep walking. War Thunder will chew you up and spit you out if you don’t put in the hours. There’s so much to learn, ballistics, flight controls, how not to accidentally nose-dive into the ground because you forgot the landing gear. The game’s idea of a tutorial is basically “Good luck, hope you like Googling stuff.” Most of your education comes from being blown up and reading angry forum posts. Progression? Oof. It’s a grind, especially past the early tiers. Unlocking new vehicles turns into a second job. You’ll start looking at Research Points and Silver Lions like they’re rationed oxygen. And the repair bills? Don’t get me started. Unless you’re super efficient or willing to open your wallet, the climb gets real steep, real fast. And yeah, money talks. Premium accounts and paid vehicles speed things up, a lot. It’s not pay-to-win, exactly, but let’s just say dropping some cash can make things a lot more comfortable. If you’re free-to-play, you can still do well, but you’ll feel the gap sometimes, especially when you get paired up with someone who clearly paid for express shipping. Looks and sounds? Chef’s kiss. The maps are gorgeous, the sunlight glints just right, and every shell impact and engine roar has that “rumble your desk” vibe. Plus, new stuff keeps dropping, vehicles, maps, the whole nine yards, so it never gets stale. The good bits: - So many vehicles you’ll never see them all - Realistic as hell physics and damage (every hit counts) - Modes for every mood, from chill to “I regret my life choices” - Sound and visuals? Top notch The not-so-great: - Learning curve is basically a brick wall - Progression slows to a crawl higher up - Premium stuff definitely gives an edge - UI and tech trees will melt your brain at first Honestly, War Thunder is less a game, more a lifestyle. It’s for people who get a weird thrill from reading armor penetration charts and debating turret speeds. If you’re patient, a little masochistic, and want the most intense, nitty-gritty vehicle combat out there, strap in. War Thunder’s gonna give you a ride.\n",

Fuf .. Well, there is nothing to say.But the stoop Emil calmly bent 3 closets and Normals in general.They just did not cure.It turns out a paradox: less armor - you live longer.- The game is not dynamic, the bushes kill.For me, this is not a particular problem, since you can replay the enemy, and the cards are large, you can fry the chicken from the flank, while they stick into the optics towards the point with red eyes.Yes, and sometimes you will spawn you literally for a kilometer and you have to be popular to the points of about 5 minutes. - Aircraft and bimbs from them :)))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))) -Arrived - died.Start first.In conclusion, I can say: do not waste time and nerves.Of course, the game is unique, literally a simulator, but there is NIANS .. Some people love BDSM (BJIYAT, as much as you can) - this is a lover and a tundra - for an amateur.And I finish my 2 weeks to prem and go to wash, touch the grass, look for a woman, build communism, arrange a coup in Ethiopia and relax in a Mexican cartel.After 2 weeks, I will supplement the review.Probably ..

      "199/4320 | nan → So, you saw the cool looking ads for those wicked looking modern jet fighters huh? wanna jump straight into one and wanna know how much it'll set you back huh? well, let's take a quick look: First, lets assume you just want a single tech tree, they have a lot of planes so it's reasonable to unlock the whole thing to give yourself some variety for when you get bored of that F-15 you're so hyped about! So lets just say you want the american tech tree, cool! So that's going to be approximately $700 to unlock them all outright, despite that you'll still need to play to gain the RP still, and at 6,034,600 rp averaging approximately 8k assuming you're good at the game and you need to play about 188 hours based on an estimated match time of 18 minutes and an xp rate of 8k to be generous that means you will need to play about 188 hours JUST to get into your f-15 or F-16. AND THEN you still need to unlock all the upgrades for any of the planes you actually care about flying, you can do this entirely free, and for the F-15 specifically that's going to be another 325,000 exp/rp which is another 12 hours or $66 (the cheapest premium currency price that will cover the cost outright) for the plane you ALREADY paid $700 for. AND THEN you need to pay the standard currency fee to buy the plane you already paid for X2, which at a cost of 1,440,000 of the standard currency is going to cost another $33 (the cheapest premium currency price that will cover the cost ouright) which you know you're gonna do because now you're in so deep that you feel obligated to have fun. AND THEN you get to realize that your ideas about air combat in modern jets being purely badass fun were deeply flawed, you die repetitively to missiles you never see coming, everyone else is mad at you because they also paid a small fortune to be here and now you're dragging them down, and you've just sunk-cost-fallacied yourself into your new hell. - Just for some context, if you're a really hardcore milsim air combat nerd who isn't afraid to learn and be patient, you can go buy the official F-16C and F/A-18C modules for about $160, that leaves you $640 for toys, you could go grab yourself the vrpil rudder pedals and all-in-one flight stick for $560~ and have $80 left to buy yourself some steak and ice cream. Take it from me, the price isn't worth it, the game isn't fun enough to justify it, and you'll feel obligated to play a game you do not enjoy. Go take a cross country road trip, pay for a ride-along in a real jet, or buy approximately 200 bags of Clover Valley Peppered Beef Jerky.\n",

The allies followed, breathing like flies.Several times, the aircraft was controlled, but it fell with a corkscrew without the opportunity to change the flight.Why in the game the opportunity to be on tanks and ships, if it is impossible for all types of equipment to participate in 1 battle ????In sea battles, shells will recapture from everything, whether it be sand, water or .. palm.I do not see the WOT alternatives, and here I simply do not have a lot of technology.Punching here is also not adequate, and more luck.Simulative battles are kindergarten.I had to see the simulator when they check everything where the 101 button affecting the flight.And here .. \"Close/Open\" plugs, \"VCL/VC\" of the engine, \"raise/lower\" the chassis.- All.The destruction of the aircraft is also monotonous and not interesting, and the pilot cannot die, what is the point of leaving the plane, or try to sit down if he gives the frag for the enemy, is there any sense - no?Chkalov, Vorozheykin, and Polishchuk would be shocked by such flights, but you know where they are adequate to break through, and to drive aircraft, and to destroy equipment, and turns?- Campaign.I understand the excitement in 2013, I liked to fly then, the old account was also not reduced to the old account, here I - Steimovskoye.Also, the progress of technology, as well as in search of tabs of technology and research, is not convenient, I compare this with the location in WOT, as it was before.In the \"Simulator\", only 8 minutes of real flight time without any control keys, except for the previously mentioned, and this time is simply to get to the middle of the card.P.S.

      "235/4320 | 76561199188694870 → In general: the game is not bad.The variety of tanks, airplanes, ships and the occasional helicopter makes it quite interesting.And you can spend some time.Pros: If you like armored vehicles, ships or airplanes, it is interesting to play.Especially if you like WW2, for the fact that it is cool to see some of the best tanks of that time, such as the Tiger (Panzer VI) or the Königest (Tiger II - King Tiger) in Germany or the Soviet T -34, among others.On the other hand, there are airplanes such as Spitfire or, in ships, Iowa. Cons: Matchmaking are a \"peanut\" (if not otherwise).Directly, many times you get an uncle who, from God he knows where, shoots you and kills you.Another thing to keep in mind is that even the most shabby tank, and even stone cardboard, kills you, even with the tank investigated to the fullest.It makes no sense.As I said before, it's fine because you have different historical tanks, but prepare to get one.It is not that it has been a long time, but the research system is absolute: it takes your life.Thing that does not mean that they have to investigate, of course, if not it would not be funny.But the problem comes when you make a battle and give you about 1000 research points, which at first you say: \"Oh, good, I am advancing in the investigation of the next tank!\"But then you realize that, when you investigate it, the next one increases a fuck.An example is from pzkw.IIIJ AL TIGER H1.One is approximately 12,000 research points (PZKW. III) and then the other is 39,000 points;It is more than double, which would not be bad if they gave you more points per place.But you can think that good, I just have to investigate 39,000 more or less.And then investigate 6 more than era 2. That is not bad, so you have more variety, but they also use a kidney and part of the other.In addition, and finally, Pay2win shows in the games: if you want a good tank, to pay.And on top of that, being premium gives advantages that, as I think, can ruin the experience.Quick conclusion: The game in general is not bad, it has some cool scenarios and the graphics are quite good.On the other hand, the balance between tanks of one country or another does not seem, in my humble opinion, to be very balanced.If you want to spend a while, you can play.The arcade assault mode with the armored ones is very good, because you practice when firing a little and you do not want to throw a bridge after a game with a clear disadvantage in realistic mode.For me: Game: 8/10 Graphics: 8.5/10 vehicles: 10/10 Progress: 6/10 Terrestrial game: 7.5 (depends on the mode; for example, the Earth's assault mode: 9/10) Air game: 8 (In this case, the aerial assault I find not fun: 6/10) General: 7.96/10 (this comment is my humble opinion.One more review, of hundreds, which expresses its time in departure).\n",

      "240/4320 | 76561199086743878 → Not your average war game – War Thunder is a beast of its own. If you're expecting just another arcade-style shooter, think again. War Thunder delivers a unique, deep, and complex military experience that no other game quite matches. From tanks to jets to helicopters – it’s a whole new level of immersion. But let’s not sugarcoat it: the game is painfully pay-to-win at times. Premium vehicles are a double-edged sword – on one hand, they give new players a shortcut; on the other, they wreck the team balance. Nothing's worse than a guy spawning one premium tank, dying, and bailing on the match, leaving you with one less teammate. Plus, some premium vehicles are just straight-up hard to counter with regular tech. Another weird take? Israel being a full tech tree while most of their stuff is imported or modified. Meanwhile, strong military nations like Brazil, India, or Turkey? Nowhere to be found. Big miss, Gaijin. New players – if you think top-tier modern jets and tanks are the most fun, brace yourself. Late Cold War stuff is often the real sweet spot. WW2-tier can be frustratingly slow, and high-tier matches are dominated by missile-spamming jets playing hide-and-seek from 10km away. Don't jump straight into modern jets unless you really know what you're doing – start with early Gen 1 jets and work your way up. If you’ve got some cash to spare, a premium account (especially during sales) makes life way easier. Grinding without one is rough, and it’s much better than relying on a single premium vehicle you're afraid to even lose. Lastly – find a good squadron ASAP. Playing solo in this game is a totally different (and much worse) experience. 8/10 when it's good, 3/10 when it's not. Still can’t stop playing.\n",

War Thunder is the kind of game that lovingly throws you into a World War-era meat grinder, gives you a gloriously detailed plane or tank, and then watches you explode five seconds after spawning—sometimes from an enemy you never even saw. And yet… you’ll click “To Battle” again with tears in your eyes and hope in your heart. After 1000 hours, I’ve learned a few truths: Friendlies will ram you more often than the enemy does. You are never safe. Not on the ground. Not in the air. Not even in the hangar. Spawn camping is a war crime, but in War Thunder, it's a tradition. If you hear a plane noise and you're in a tank… it's already too late. Graphically, it’s stunning. The sound design is chef’s kiss. When you hear that distant whistle of an incoming bomb, followed by instant silence, you know it’s War Thunder doing what it does best—reminding you that life is fleeting, but digital war is forever. Is it pay-to-win? Sometimes. Do I still play it religiously? Absolutely. Will I ever financially recover from that one BR 6.7 game? Probably not. War Thunder isn’t just a game. It’s a lifestyle. A personality trait. A high-stakes Stockholm syndrome simulator. 10/10 would get shot through three buildings by a German tank destroyer again.\n",

But, pushed by a friend (in real life, he literally harassed me to get back to it), I relaunched the game at the end of 2023 ... and I took a hell of a slap.War Thunder is a very good game. The gameplay is rich, controlled.Access to planes, tanks and boats from several nations.Very good replayability.Quickly addictive content.Other factors have influenced my opinion (I am a fan of Girls und Panzer and realistic war games like Hearts of Iron IV, for example).But I did not think I would rediscover this game in a new light.Today, this is the second game that I stream the most on my Twitch channel.However, you have to qualify: the game is very addictive.Remember to wipe your Seum before playing.It is not a game made for irritable or likely people.It is hard, sometimes random.There is premium content, of course, but it remains generally easy to ignore and only influences the parties, except for your personal progress.The cat can quickly become toxic - I see you, the “Attack the D Point!”- And above all ...

But grind system: you install the game, play there and discover the extremely long search tree, you see that what you gain in part is derium without your premium account.But that's not enough.So, you buy a premium vehicle .. And that's it, you are ordered to pay vehicles for each tree .. (game insitting strongly at the paid gameplay), you are taken for a milk cow and it is disturbing nothing in return -the BR: you discover that your vehicles have small figures under their card that correspond to their \"levels\" (armor, mobility, year,Account that partly you face vehicles that have the same figures but not only!You can come across vehicles with a figure above you or a figure below, which creates a huge imbalance in part because sometimes, because of this system, expired tanks of the Second World War confront vehicles of the Cold War. Imagine a Tiger 2 which has the CH1 chasse with each acceleration facing an American M48 .. just stupid.-the account transfers: I spent a lot of money (1018.97 euros) in War Thunder when I was on console .. I finished 3 nations and I knew, so 2 weeks ago I spend my account on PC because I received my PC and there .. They withdrew my days of premium account and I no longer have the right to buy vehicles .. - Boredom: there is not 1000 gameplay ..Normal with three difficulties without counting the competitions so we quickly go around. We launch the same games, do the same things and it becomes boring.-the change: War Thunder is a game without any competitor so they do not need to stand out since in terms of motorized war games they are already at the top of the podium .. the most vehicles .. crazy details ... realistic details that the armies train on it .. so no need to change its more zero events than the others and no need to create fun.Textual, or you will often see words quite controversy by their stories. I let you imagine the conversation in its chats -the technology too advance: in War Thunder, especially by plane, the more you progress and win in BR, plus your planes on good missils, radar etc ...that when you are already at 7 meters above the floors ... which you notch ... and that the missils make you still a big kisses ... you can do nothing more ... and the solution is not to enlarge the maps as do the gaijin in summary: if you have money and time to waste, it is an incredible game of its realism, but frankly .. too much time and especially their playersmoney invested in the game, so that's why I drop it,\n",

In Ground RB, players are encouraged to take tactical positions, learn weak spots, manage engagements and flank. It is extremely satisfying to get kills in Ground RB in a tank against an enemy tank, especially with the kill cam. And the best way to rack up kills is to take into account of the survivability onion; don't be seen, don't be identified, don't be hit etc.. Thus, you are further encouraged to flank, manage engine noises, set up ambushes / strike from behind whilst unseen. However, with planes in Ground RB, that doesn't matter. A player in a plane can always spot you from above, mark you for their team, in which there are usually two endings: 1) you get killed by an enemy tank since you got marked, or 2) you get bombed. Sure you can counter enemy planes in Ground RB by playing an SPAA, but then you're mostly just hunting planes and not actually engaging with satisfying tank vs tank gameplay. Or you can increase your grind by twofold and grind out aviation too, but then you're also just taken away from the tank vs tank gameplay. In short, War Thunder has an extremely fun and satisfying tank vs tank Ground RB battle, if planes weren't there. For those who come from wargaming, planes are essentially worse than SPGs in WoT, and worse than CV in WoWS. They share the similarity of being nigh impossible to counter for the usual tanks you would like to play in a supposedly tank game mode. However, if you're not here for tanks and instead here for planes, the Air Arcade Battle and Air Realistic Battle are both extremely fun. Just don't expect a good time in Ground RB if you're here for tanks.\n",

      "320/4320 | nan → At first the game was great but with each update it got worse and worse. In general, you can play the game but on SOVIET or RUSSIAN tanks and planes, because this equipment is intentionally made better than it is and Soviet equipment in general on lower BR etc. to win. (the best tank is rusian, the best missiles R73 - R77 also as the best plane with X 38MT the best anti-aircraft armor and ships). I generally keep quiet about the so-called bugs because there is a certain system in the game that because you donated or simply because you are a beginner, PANTSIR will destroy your palne everywhere and you will not pass damage from more trained players. And shells works not like in real life. I'M SILENT ABOUT THE CARRIER: ANTI-AGING JUST KILLS THE GAME ON PLANES, AND IF THEY ADD THE BUK THERE WILL BE NO PLACE FOR AVIATION AT ALL. Therefore, until the game is made normal and more realistic, I won't change my opinion. To sum up big snail got me at first but but now he just sucks money It is also VERY HARD to play without a donate, rusian and Soviet technology deliberately overbuffed, built-in cheating game for new players (wallet warriors) IS DESTROYING GAME. I hope one day Bulannikov (AK Bullpupnikov) will do something with game will start do it better and will stop suffering from sexual attraction to the Soviet-rusia desire schizophrenia and schizophrenia at all, will stop crashing on planes and helicopters in his game, will stop puting rusian botlles in butthole and will start playing in his sh*t game at all.

Absolutely free access!Yeah, and then you wake up.First impressions: The war never looked so beautiful at first glance is War Thunder war dream.You enter the battle, the crew is ready, you know the map, you have a plan.You point, shoot .. Reflection.The enemy will see you and one blow will send you to eternal tank hunting grounds.The game informs you that you have lost your driver, shooter, tower, belt, engine and self -confidence.And also 2500 credits for repair.You'll get it at that moment.This game is not free.This is a war MMORPG about the survival of the poor.Community: The army of experts with explosive emotions think that when they destroyed you, at least those teammates will help.Error.War Thunder community = perfect mix: historical encyclopedias on steroids (\"This cannon does not have a real 162 mm penetration, but 159! Gaijine, fixni!\"Everything is solved in the platoon, but not a team game.And when you shoot someone down, it is quite possible to write to you, \"Pay2win noob\" - even if you just destroyed the enemy in a stock tank with a cannon from the sewing machine.Gameplay: Genius design with a sense for Sadism War Thunder punishes you for trying to play for free.Developers will give you a premium tank in the test drive - and then let you suffer.Because what you have is from the last century and obviously from another universe.You play against the players who have: Heat-FS ammunition with the soul of a demon, faster reload than toilet paper in McDonald's, and a credit card that has more HP than your tank.And yet the game still convinces you, \"You can do it, just takes a little training.\"No.He doesn't want to.It takes a premium account, gold, and maybe both kidneys.AKA \"Grind Simulator 1945+\" The game promises to get to modern tanks.You just have to play a few games .. More precisely: 1100 battles, 72 hours of pure playing, and ideally born in a golden family, because without paying you will go forever with BT-5 and pray for criticism.If you get tired of tanks, you can try aircraft.And re -go through the same spiral pain.Result?You play 3 factions and find that you could make a tractor driver for that time and fly with the drone really.Skins?Thanks, but no!Fortunately, there are no skins .. Wait, they are!But not like in CS: GO.Here you have whole vehicles as a premium version.And not only appearance, they are better.So while you have the tank with a paper armor, your opponent has a Swedish UFO with reactive armor and armor conscience.And guess what?You can buy it too.Just .. 50 euros.And a little self -denial.Summary: War Thunder is as if you decided to play chess with someone who has three more kings, a premium of titanium figures and the right to pull twice.And you?You're the pawn who didn't want to spend and believed that the skill could handle it.VERDICT: + Great feeling of shot + detailed models and realistic physics + amazing when you are not playing + a combination of tanks, aircraft and ships in one game - Economics from Hell - Matchmaking like a casino - community that will cry without a shot - a premium advantage?Yes.And how!Rating: Game: 8/10 Community: 3/10 Economics: 1/10 Overall: 4/10 (or 9/10, if you have a gold credit card) PS: I played over Gaijin Launcher !!!A total of about 200 hours in ass!\n",

Gaijin is continuously pushing the boundaries and testing the limits of its players. If you are familiar with the game \"Escape from Tarkov,\" you probably know the consequences when game developers constantly provoke their player base. As players of this game, we contribute to its activity, and in theory, Gaijin should appreciate each and every one of us who continues to support and encourage this game. However, Gaijin keeps pushing the boundaries and exploiting each and every one of us. This recent economic change is not just a simple adjustment, Gaijin is gradually making it clear that if you don't pay for this game, you don't deserve to play it.I implore every player here to bravely stand up and resist this behavior. Gaijin has now infringed upon our rights as players, and we cannot, and should not, let Gaijin continue to exploit us in the future. It is time for us players to unite and stand together. We should be a collective, a class, opposing Gaijin's exploitation and oppression towards us. We are here to enjoy this game, to find joy in it, and we should not be working for Gaijin.1 hope that each player will save and spread this message. This post will undoubtedly be deleted, but we should copy it, share it, on any platform, anywhere that allows us to make our voices heard. Fellow warriors,\n",

The patch also happens to break ALL missiles, making them do 0-10% of their expected damage June 27th: A hotfix that claims to fix missile is deployed. Missile damage now works about 50% of the time, but a new bug is introduced reducing the damage of all explosive shells (even 20 mm ones) by 90%. Meaning that the hotfix broke more planes than it fixed. June 30th: A 2nd hotfix is deployed that claims to fix the shell damage bug introduced by the previous hotfix. The community consensus is that cannons are still consistently broken. Missiles are work perhaps 75% of the time now.

      "445/4320 | 76561198119800540 → There are plenty of other reviews for War Thunder that mirror my feelings for the game and the devs. Read those and take them to heart, but if you're browsing Steam while queuing for a match then feel free to read this too. TLDR: Like tanks? Gunner Heat PC. Like planes? DCS World or IL 2 Sturmovik. Like ships? Uboat, Cold Waters, or Sea Power Disclaimer: I have only ever played air arcade, air realistic, and air sim modes. Mileage may vary depending on what you want from the game. I started playing War Thunder in 2016 (I think) when the MiG-15 and Sabre were the golden-children top-tier aircraft of the game. I remember test-flying the British Meteor for the first time, finally having reached the jet-age after playing for over a year. At the time, the devs wanted you to grind for top tier aircraft and vehicles. There were no premium jets specifically because they wanted you to work your way to the top. I remember being a little surprised when they eventually did add premium jets, although I could understand the reasoning, as the grind for the newest top-tier aircraft at the time had become even more suffocating than it was when I began playing. But then they added another, and another, and another. However, while I'm complaining about how many premium jets they've added, I've also let myself buy a few over the last few years; for a game I spend so much time on, I was ok spending some money on a sale once or twice a year. In fact, I almost pre-ordered the $80 premium F/A-18 they added in the most recent update (Leviathans), but instead spent the money on DCS after playing it in the weeks before the Leviathans update released. Anyone could've told me this months or years ago, but this update made it clear to me that the devs only see this game as a way to funnel money to their pockets, and they care just enough about the game to make it playable so people keep spending money on it. They now excitedly release top-tier premium aircraft for people to skip the grind for a measly $80. For that money, you can buy a full fidelity model of a DCS aircraft, two copies of pretty much any other multiplayer game to play with a friend, groceries for a week, gas for a month, or even turn off the game for once and treat your parents to dinner on you. No matter what the devs say, they don't care about you or the game. Or maybe they do, but just enough to make sure you'll cough up the cash for the next update's 15 different $80 premium aircraft. And don't forget that update will also break the core mechanics of the game for at least a week, despite spending over a month on the dev server. The advertising for this game is a mess, too. I continue to get YouTube ads for War Thunder almost every day, and I've watched them go from showing cool WWII tank combat in their 2018ish ads, to now displaying the newest and fanciest aircraft like the F-16 or SU-27. They used to be proud to show off the game, and now just want to show you the shiny new things that will make you open your wallet again. Inevitably, I will continue to spend my time playing this game because it scratches an itch I can't explain. I might even spend money on the game again when the winter sale comes around, but I'll hate that I want to. TLDR (again): 7/10 would fly again, and you have a hole in your left wing\n",

This game, while it can be good at times, has had some very awful updates recently, as well as leaning more into pay-to-win vehicles and paid camouflage patterns. Since the most recent majot update \"Leviathan\", there have been almost daily bug fix updates for weeks now, tanks collision detection is totally broken, plane controls are incredibly wonky now, and just problems after problems. You can read their fix logs, and that's only 1/2 of the issues. I used to really enjoy War Thunder, it's by far my highest played game on steam despite me having plenty of hours in other games since all the way back in 2006, but this update has made the game awful and I would not recommend you get into this game if you're new.

Now this is not a game about vanshots.I would also like to note such a thing as the RPU.I will not say anything, because it is impossible to prove its existence and functioning at the moment.But shoot at the same 0.4 cd beer in any projection with any type of shell without damage, by high.Especially if after that the same vegetable, thanks to the “realistic marker” that will show from which side you shot at it, will shoot in your direction and show magic outside Hogwarts who killed you in a random pixel despite how many armor and what a shell is.Get the conclusion for yourself whether it is worth playing this garbage dump, but for me personally here the number of minuses is clearly more than the number of advantages.\n",

Gaijin is continuously pushing the boundaries and testing the limits of its players. If you are familiar with the game \"Escape from Tarkov,\" you probably know the consequences when game developers constantly provoke their player base. As players of this game, we contribute to its activity, and in theory, Gaijin should appreciate each and every one of us who continues to support and encourage this game. However, Gaijin keeps pushing the boundaries and exploiting each and every one of us. This recent economic change is not just a simple adjustment, Gaijin is gradually making it clear that if you don't pay for this game, you don't deserve to play it.I implore every player here to bravely stand up and resist this behavior. Gaijin has now infringed upon our rights as players, and we cannot, and should not, let Gaijin continue to exploit us in the future. It is time for us players to unite and stand together. We should be a collective, a class, opposing Gaijin's exploitation and oppression towards us. We are here to enjoy this game, to find joy in it, and we should not be working for Gaijin.1 hope that each player will save and spread this message. This post will undoubtedly be deleted, but we should copy it, share it, on any platform, anywhere that allows us to make our voices heard. Fellow warriors\n",

U will have like two, maybe 3 bot games, and then its just NOTHING but torture. The grind is HORRIBLE, and the matchmaking is GARBAGE. However, most of why this game is crap isn't even cause of the devs in my opinion. Ppl just like all games, want to ruin everything for everyone else. Its NOTHING but horrible teammates, flankers, and even WORSE flankers. I'm talking about ppl who don't give a crap about the main objective which is to capture a point or 2 out of 3 to win. they just go to edge of the map and camp ur spawn, or they storm ur spawn. They will ALSO just storm spawn after getting one cap point out of 3. DON'T depend on ur teammates!! They will not save u like 90% of the time. SO MANY TIMES u will be out classed by other vehicles, and then u get that vehicle, and u never outclass anything. SO MANY HACKERS. AND SO MANY PPL WHO USE NOTHING BUT PREMIUMS. Such an unfair advantage. Litteraly pay to win. AND to make things worse, if u use free tanks, u have to then GRIND that vehicle just to be able to use it fully. Premuims dont have to do that. Honestly, I can't recommend this game, even though it's SO MUCH FUN when it goes right. It just ins't worth it. I have about 1k hrs rn combining two steam accounts. U won't be able to progress, or at least not very fast. It's honestly a shock that this game hasn't died. NEWCOMERS BEWARE: It will become NOTHING but RAGE. The game itself is so good. However, its been ruined by the devs, and the community, and tbh, I don't even blame Gaijin. Gaijin don't control what the players do.\n",

The enemy loader yawns. Still waiting on Gaijin to discover what \"spalling\" and \"pressure trauma\" actually are. But the British tank tree is built around shell types that rely on mechanics Gaijin hasnt implemented properly, and now \"spall liners\" are being added to other nations' tanks first, making British solid shot and APDS even less effective. (They are already a running joke in the community) On top of that, bombers are still neglected, with broken damage models, poor rewards, and little developer communication. If you’re planning to main British tanks or bombers in any nation, I genuinely can’t recommend it. If you're playing Russia, you're in luck! I'll change my review when they actually address the above issues or at least communicate it. Bonus info!: Despite making a stupid amount of money, they still do some rather dodgy practices when they get a chance. The company, despite being more successful/profitable than all other games in its niche, also doesn't support charities like they do.

      "599/4320 | nan → id recommend not playing this game if you have never played it before. only experienced people play anymore. they rank you by battle rating of your planes, no matter level. so you usually get in a lobby of level 100 because they are the only ones playing this game anymore. you get no chance to learn because most all the players have vastly more experience than you and even if you play at the lowest battle rating. which doesn't sound bad but in a game like this making a single mistake can send you back to the lobby, and playing with people that know how to exploit these mistakes, when you don't even know what you are doing, is the most infuriating experience ever. 90% of my games ends with me dying in the first burst of fire from an enemy, even after watching tutorials and having experience in other aviation games its next to impossible to learn on this game because you get about 10 seconds of game time out of a 8 minute match when you die first burst. Also massive wastes of boosters, they should really give them back to you if you don't get points, why would i want 300% of 100 xp? At that why do i only get 100 or so experience for 8 minutes in battle when i can get 3000 from air arcade pve? I could continue to go on but I hope i got some of the experience happening currently across. i wish they would fix the match making but they never will, all of their games have this flaw Edit i want to add on to this review as that is only one side of things when you get bad matchmaking. the game itself is very well made in the fact of their controls for air vehicles, realism, and amount of content. the games visuals are very good but still feels like and arcade game at times. physics seem to be very good as well on both air and ground. there is a lot to work for in the game, usually to get to vehicles you may want, you have to research other lines to be able to progress for enough to achieve that higher \"tier\" vehicles. doesn't mean you have to play different vehicles, but you're going to spend a ton of time researching stuff you may not want to use, or never may use. i still haven't changed my recommendation from a no solely because it sucks to play against people with 1000s of hours which is most matches still. will update if i still play the game EDIT 2 STILL DONT RECOMMEND, i hate this game and cannot wait till someone comes out with some vehicle sim that is similiar, because matchmaking is the worst thing in the world, worse than a call of duty lobby, but cant really find the air vehicles in anything other than ace combat for modern planes edit 3 since it keeps asking m,e what i think of the game still, it is absolute trash, i can not wait till another company comes out with a some what relistic (this game is not realistic but it feels beter than ace combat) air combat game. this game is literally un playable at times and it was the worst decision of my life to start playing this piece of crap, hunk of junk, dumpster fire, money grab hungry, life depressing game because i want to play it but it just so frustrating its stupid\n",

      "860/4320 | 76561199782877531 → War Thunder: A critical analysis of the War Thunder game experience is a game that, at first glance, impresses with the variety of vehicles and the realistic combat proposal between tanks, airplanes and ships.However, by diving deeper, the player faces several barriers that negatively affect the experience, especially for those who are new or play casually.Debalancing of equipment and tiers Although the progression system tries to be realistic, in practice there is a striking gap between players who have different tiers vehicles.For example, Tier 1 tanks may end up facing Tier 2 vehicles, which have a much higher armor, speed and firepower.This generates unfair clashes, where the player has little chance of victory.Game time difference players with a few hours, for example less than 100, are often placed against veterans over 1000 or 1500 hours.The latter not only dominate the game in terms of mechanics and maps, but also have superior vehicles and improvements, creating a very difficult barrier for beginners and casual players.Tiring and timely progression Progression in War Thunder is notoriously slow and tiring.To unlock better vehicles and improvements, the player needs to invest many hours of play, which can demotivate those looking for a more fluid experience.This slowness in advance reinforces the pressure to spend real money, increasing the feeling that progress depends more on financial investment than skill.Matchmaking inconsistent The matchmaking system often ignores the player's complete set, focusing only on the main vehicle's Battle rating (BR).This causes players to be placed in much more advanced opponents, even when your vehicle as a whole is not up to.The result is unbalanced and demotivating matches.ABUSIVE PRICES The monetization model is another negative point.Premium items and vehicles are sold for values ​​that can range from $ 100 to $ 200 or more, which is too high for virtual items.This reinforces the “pay-to-win” model, where those who pay have faster access to higher equipment, further increasing the inequality between players.About Hacks - A more balanced view despite common online games problems, War Thunder positively surprises in this regard.During the gaming experience, no clear cheat interference was found, which makes the competitive environment fairer compared to many other multiplayer games if you do not call what was presented and a very good and addictive game but has its serious defects\n",

      "879/4320 | nan → In principle, the game is average, maybe above average.Of the pluses, this is a technique, or rather its number.You can ride both on buckets of prehistoric times and the time of VMV, and on modern buckets with thermal imagers and scraps.The graphics in the game as a whole is also not bad in my humble glance.Cool customization of the technique, you can cure the tank with bushes for disguise, glue the decs, there are also different kites of the type of helmets, machine guns, road signs and other crap, which can also be hung on a tank.The game has adjacent battles on tanks and aircraft.You can go into battle on the tank, grab a point, kill one enemy and jump onto the plane throw bombs on the enemy’s head.And then from the pluses we smoothly go to the minuses, because adjacent battles are also a minus.It is unrealistic to play high ranks, after a couple of minutes the plays simply sit on helicopters and just let the enemy go to the enemy from spavna, even there is no need to fly anywhere.The first time after the input, I heard that the helicopters fell into the battles to the Mauses))) Mausam, Karl))) In the game, they really like to sit somewhere behind a pebble or bush and shoot 5-6 frags.Some manage on heavy tanks to sit on the spavs behind the stones and shoot.By the way, the cards are small, on high ranks, where tanks ride quite quickly, it is difficult to play.In the first minutes of the battle, one of the teams occupies strategic positions on the map, a couple of minutes, and this team is already storming the opponent’s rep.In the game, in my opinion in my opinion, it was difficult for me to deal with the work of some air defense models in my opinion.The interface as a beginner can also be intuitively incomprehensible and complicated.The game has a game mode against bots that almost no one plays.There are simulator battles, xs what is online, I think also small.For some reason, the game has ships for playing them on them.Perhaps someone is interested, but I personally do not, I have never played there.The technique in the game is downloading for a long time and boring.All equipment has the same pumping of modules, and the pumping strategy is also the same everywhere.In general, a game of an amateur.If Belarusian tanks were sophisticated, you can try to play snails, but be prepared for the fact that this is the Kingdom of Vanshots and the question \"Yes!?\"You will regularly shout.But, having been attached to play, you will open super vision, and you can see the tanks everywhere.And in the bushes, and in stones, and where they are not at all, but you directly feel that someone is standing there.If you have vision problems, play Var Tanter, it pumps your vision cooler than the blueberries of Forte XD\n",

      "929/4320 | 76561199247115185 → In my view, I would like to draw attention to a serious problem in War Thunder's matchmaking system, which in particular affects new players.In low BR levels (e.g. 1.0-3.0), very experienced players regularly meet beginners-some with level 100 and several thousand hours.These often use strong premium vehicles or their favorite tanks to \"Sealclubben\" in these areas.For new players who have no experience or good vehicles yet, this is massively frustrating and often ensures that they leave the game directly.I think was Thunder from a long -term healthy community - and that also includes new players have the chance to get into play fairly.My suggestion: Introduction of a \"entry-level matchmaking\", the player with less than z.B. 50 hours of play or under level 20 alternatively separates: Soft limit for high-level players in very low BR levels (e.g. no BR under 2.7 from level 70) Introduction of a kind of beginner protection zone (e.g. own queue or additional rewards for fair fights) I hope my concern is taken seriously, otherwise many new players will be lost in the long term.\n",

British vehicles like lets say the Challenger TES or Churchill are completely nerfed compared to their real life counterparts. This gives countries like Britain a bad military reputation outside of the game aswell, while making Russia seem even stronger than it is in real life. Britain isnt the only struggling nation (that shouldn't be) in war thunder, i just used it as an example.

And if you do play it, don’t give them money. They routinely break the monetary system anyway and will leave it that way for 6-8 months while they clear a few paychecks and then they’ll act like they didn’t know what was wrong. If you are a console player moving to PC be advised they have frozen account transfers indefinitely because the devs are too lazy to automate the process.

There are just to many vehicles to grind now and Gaijin is making it more pay to win than ever. If you have your sights set on a tank you think you may like in the top tier like rank 7 just forget about it. You will have to dump endless amounts of money into this game to get the tank you want and you still wont be satisfied. And if you don't want to spend any money at all good luck playing the game! I'm not kidding when i say this, it will take you months or years to get the tanks you want or to fully grind out a certain tree. If you are a free to play player just set your sights on the lower ranks and WW2-coldwar vehicles. Any vehicles after that playing Free to play will be pretty much impossible to get or take Months of of your life. So just do yourself a solid and play this game at your own demise knowing what to expect!\n",

      "1100/4320 | nan → The game is good, but I started on PlayStation. I got really competitive. I had right around $3,000.00 dollars invested into my account for various items like vehicles, and upgrades, as well as crew. So eventually I got even more serious with the game by competing in Squadron Battles. So I bought a PC, and made the switch for the first time in my life from console. Then, when I went to try and link my console PS4 account to my New PC account, I couldn't! I contacted War Thunder Support, and I was told there was a day in the past in which there was a cutoff to transfer console accounts in that manner in which I was trying to do. So, because that was more than a year prior to my attempt. I wasn't allowed to do it they said. They wouldn't help me. So I'm out all my money, and have completely lost interest because of a very dumb thing that I had no control over, and really shouldn't even be a thing! People invest a lot of real money into this game, and to get screwed when you try and upgrade your ability to be better at the game. Since if your not on PC your at a very clear, and distinct disadvantage when going up against other Cross Platform Players. I was so emotionally defeated by the inability to have the only account I've ever had. An account with so much time, sweat, money, and soul poured into it, that I just couldn't start all over. I tried. I put about 500 hours into it, but I felt then, and still now as if I was robbed. I hope one day they will change that, and allow me to get my main account linked to my PC. I miss this game so much!!!\n",

      "1104/4320 | nan → Please don't download this game, read a few lines before you get mad at me and stop reading: The game is a big trap. At first you see this game somewhere and download it thinking what a nice game, then you choose one of several nationalities and start playing. While this is going on nicely, after a while you start to progress and not enjoy it because the game is P2W. If it is only p2w, there is no problem, the matchmaking system of the game is terrible, while you are level 5, you can find a level 100 man in front of you, so your game pleasure is ruined because experience is important in the game. Also high level people have camouflage like bushes (most of them) Now let's go back to the trap part, as you open the vehicle, you want to open the vehicle, but each time it becomes more and more terrible, it is a complete dopamine trap. If you watch 40 hours of short videos instead of this game, it will have the same effect. For those who like this game from a historical point of view, I have nothing to say, the only thing this game does well is to make you feel and enjoy the vehicles you drive. I also have a suggestion for the matching system. Open a new mode where high level players can play with low level tanks so that other modes are more fair. Anyway thank you for reading please do not download this game.\n",

      "1120/4320 | 76561199802090632 → ABRBSBGaijin Gaijin To all the players of War Thunder:I believe everyone has noticed the recent changes in the in-game economy, whether it's for naval, ground, air battles, AB, RB, or SB. Gaijin is continuously pushing the boundaries and testing the limits of its players. If you are familiar with the game \"Escape from Tarkov,\" you probably know the consequences when game developers constantly provoke their player base. As players of this game, we contribute to its activity, and in theory, Gaijin should appreciate each and every one of us who continues to support and encourage this game. However, Gaijin keeps pushing the boundaries and exploiting each and every one of us. This recent economic change is not just a simple adjustment, Gaijin is gradually making it clear that if you don't pay for this game, you don't deserve to play it.I implore every player here to bravely stand up and resist this behavior. Gaijin has now infringed upon our rights as players, and we cannot, and should not, let Gaijin continue to exploit us in the future. It is time for us players to unite and stand together. We should be a collective, a class, opposing Gaijin's exploitation and oppression towards us. We are here to enjoy this game, to find joy in it, and we should not be working for Gaijin.1 hope that each player will save and spread this message. This post will undoubtedly be deleted, but we should copy it, share it, on any platform, anywhere that allows us to make our voices heard. Fellow warriors\n",

There was no modern technology even when they added the first tanks in 2012, it was even a hit, zero target rockets, bombs, radars and other hens. A stage that leads crazy ... once playing a tank in 90%armor .. Added to this, there were many aspects that just gave fun - now the game looks like you get a rocket from a goal 12,000m away, you have absolutely no way to avoid it, and the worst when you hit a person who after losing the tank flies in the form of revenge, dropping everything she has, just so that you will lose your tank.Playing with a pleasant loose game that required a bit of skill and thinking has become a brainless comparisoner which rocket is able to get more accurately from a distance ..

      "1200/4320 | 76561197971393838 → There was a time that I would have recommended this game. Maybe 8 years ago.. No kill cam in realistic maps, properly sized for the BR. It was nice. Those days are long gone. What you have now is \"Spawn Camping Simulator 2025\". That is all this game is. At low tiers it is spawn camping in aircraft. At higher BRs it is spawn camping in tanks. Either way it is a rush to camp the spawn. And that is just ground RB. Air RB is perhaps worse. It is a death match with no real strategy involved. No point in doing strike missions, no point in bombing. Also, Hackers are still quite prevalent in Ground RB. Bravo to the Devs for banning 40K of them in one go, but there is more to go for sure. I dont think they are motivated to put effort in to banning them and policing the game. If what you want is a rush to spawn camp and World of Tanks but without a hit point system then you have found your game. As to how to fix this game that used to be great.. larger maps and rolling objectives would be a great start. The Devs probably will not do that because they want quick maps and frustrated players that will spend money. Sadly I feel like the devs have catered to the lowest common denominator who have also cried the loudest. In doing so, the game has been hijacked and turned in WoT without hit points. Is it pretty? Yes. certainly. Is it worth playing? Not anymore.\n",

      "1203/4320 | 76561199633099447 → ABRBSBGaijin Gaijin To all the players of War Thunder:I believe everyone has noticed the recent changes in the in-game economy, whether it's for naval, ground, air battles, AB, RB, or SB. Gaijin is continuously pushing the boundaries and testing the limits of its players. If you are familiar with the game \"Escape from Tarkov,\" you probably know the consequences when game developers constantly provoke their player base. As players of this game, we contribute to its activity, and in theory, Gaijin should appreciate each and every one of us who continues to support and encourage this game. However, Gaijin keeps pushing the boundaries and exploiting each and every one of us. This recent economic change is not just a simple adjustment, Gaijin is gradually making it clear that if you don't pay for this game, you don't deserve to play it.I implore every player here to bravely stand up and resist this behavior. Gaijin has now infringed upon our rights as players, and we cannot, and should not, let Gaijin continue to exploit us in the future. It is time for us players to unite and stand together. We should be a collective, a class, opposing Gaijin's exploitation and oppression towards us. We are here to enjoy this game, to find joy in it, and we should not be working for Gaijin.1 hope that each player will save and spread this message. This post will undoubtedly be deleted, but we should copy it, share it, on any platform, anywhere that allows us to make our voices heard. Fellow warriors\n",

      "1239/4320 | nan → War Thunder might look like a detailed military sim on the surface, but underneath is one of the most frustrating, predatory games out there. The grind is absolutely brutal, it takes dozens of hours just to unlock mid-tier vehicles, and even then, you’re constantly outclassed unless you pay. The economy is a joke, deliberately designed to push players into opening their wallets. Matchmaking is inconsistent at best and broken at worst, often pitting new players against veterans with vastly superior load outs. Instead of just letting you play against people at your own rank or \"tier\" of tanks, you are almost constantly versing a battle rank higher, and while it wont matter much in all your tanks, its very noticeable in a lot of the factions. Server issues, endless bugs, and a developer team that seems more interested in monetisation than meaningful game play improvements round out the mess. Unless you enjoy wasting your time or spending money to stay relevant, avoid War Thunder. Other than that, its a pretty good time sink, and the tank combat is insanely fun, and unmatched by any other game. That's their winning point. I don't recommend you play, but I will play it.\n",

For example the Missles in this update (only one of many bugs, where some are gamebreaking) The \"render and spotting\" system in ground realistic is also a point that does not get in my brain. Tanks just dont render (and dont have any sound) for you even when directly shooting or driving in your vicinity. A simple house is enough sometimes. There are some good videos on YT if you fancy to know more about this \"mechanic\" This game needs 1 or 2 whole patches without any content just to stay ahead of all the issues it has at the moment. Also the grind is just getting more and more insane. And no! just buying and playing a high tier prem should never be a solution for that.. Then the pricing for premium vehicles gets more and more out of hand. It seems they price it to be \"on normal prices\" when on 50% sale once or twice a year. And lastly dont forget about the new TOS updates. -> Your Account can (and most likely will) be deleted for not playing this game for 3 years. (i dont even talk about the new possibilities for banning accounts for ingame actions) Just for your information, my Account was created early 2013 and i already took 2 times a break of about 3 years where i didnt play the game at all. (i have over 1200 vehicles unlocked, dozen of premiums and event vehicles that are worth alot like Obj.279 and other stuff) To just delete an Account where money and a huge ammount of time (for drops, grind, events,..) was spent it seems rather illegal. But this is just a humble imo. Hopefully somebody at Gaijin reads this and takes actions, because i am about to have another (maybe long) break.\n",

      "1320/4320 | 76561198287189225 → Yeah, It's alright I guess. I sold my soul to the snail many years ago. It has been an endless grind between different tech trees and nations. Tireless hours spent in and out of battles. But to be honest? I regret none of it. All of those hours spent working towards my next vehicle, every dollar spent to appease Gaijin. Now that I stand at the precipice of my personal achievements. I have to say, Everything was worth it. I have yet to find any game that is able to draw me in and keep going even after a brutal string of losses (Gotta love the top tier BVR game play). Call it Love, Devotion or Insanity, War Thunder is and likely always will be my favourite game. If you're mad at the game play, or at the fact that you have to grind out tech trees; I'm going to hold your hand as I say this, It is a skill issue. Get good, Win some matches and the grind is less painful. If it is really too bad, then buy some premium and stop whining about spending money, If you don't like the free experience provided to you, then feel free to join the rest of us and invest in your hobby. Also slow down and enjoy early/Mid tier, buying your way to top tier or even early Jets, will not replace the experience and flight time you will gain from actually playing the game. If you are suffering in your P-51, Bf-109 or Spitfire, despite what the saltier players will say, buying a premium Russian jet will not give you some super advantage. Practice makes progress; keep on grinding, watch some videos on how to play and just keep playing. And if you don't agree with me, or feel like you have to justify hating on WT. Just delete the game and move on, It's literally a free game with nearly endless hours of game play.\n",

      "1390/4320 | 76561199010218759 → ABRBSBGaijin Gaijin To all the players of War Thunder:I believe everyone has noticed the recent changes in the in-game economy, whether it's for naval, ground, air battles, AB, RB, or SB. Gaijin is continuously pushing the boundaries and testing the limits of its players. If you are familiar with the game \"Escape from Tarkov,\" you probably know the consequences when game developers constantly provoke their player base. As players of this game, we contribute to its activity, and in theory, Gaijin should appreciate each and every one of us who continues to support and encourage this game. However, Gaijin keeps pushing the boundaries and exploiting each and every one of us. This recent economic change is not just a simple adjustment, Gaijin is gradually making it clear that if you don't pay for this game, you don't deserve to play it.I implore every player here to bravely stand up and resist this behavior. Gaijin has now infringed upon our rights as players, and we cannot, and should not, let Gaijin continue to exploit us in the future. It is time for us players to unite and stand together. We should be a collective, a class, opposing Gaijin's exploitation and oppression towards us. We are here to enjoy this game, to find joy in it, and we should not be working for Gaijin.1 hope that each player will save and spread this message. This post will undoubtedly be deleted, but we should copy it, share it, on any platform, anywhere that allows us to make our voices heard. Fellow warriors\n",

      "1410/4320 | 76561199063667820 → Hello, dear Internet users.I want to share my comment with you for this game.But for starters, I will tell you my short story why I decided to play this game.I had a difficult childhood, often I was beaten in the sandbox. Little children and their parents complained about me by my adoptive parent, although I was only 17. I had a lot of interesting hobbies.For example, I quietly accompanied the girls that I liked, because their good in relation to me could not be ignored.I did not want to show them my gratitude and therefore did everything secretly.And sometimes I still remained to look after their porch so that any thief would not burst to them.I also always publicly condemned those boys who joked over them, offered to meet with them, and also go to visit them for the night (you can see for playing a monopoly (this is my favorite game, I think that everyone plays it!)).One wonderful day, my foster mother asked me: - Son, do you have a girlfriend?- asked mom.“Um .. no ...” I answered fearfully.- How is it not?I was in vain to all my lovers told that all the girls are running after you in the yard?- Mom asked with a surprised face.- Well, what should I do?If all the girls are old women who are more than seventy years old, and the younger is not paid attention to me.- Turn.Try to start talking with girls in the classroom, with whom it will turn out with whom and you will meet .. otherwise I seemed to be in vain to her lovers .. - Okay, mothers.- I answered with a sad face.- So, I need to try to find a girl for myself so that my mother understands that I am not a sucker and is capable of breeding offspring!- I said to myself.After that, I went into my room and sat there for a long time ... I thought what girls I like, because I used to play only with young children.And specifically to solve my problem, I decided to go to the popular Max platform and chose the video “How to find a girl” ... The next day there was such a conversation: -What up, Mother - I said with sadness.“Hello, my Hangstirochik,” my mother asked with curiosity, “are you so sad?”- Mom, I fell in love with one girl, but she has a boyfriend, what should I do?- I said with tears.- Valera!Go court, our pepsik fell in love!- shouted mom.A man flew out of the room towards the kitchen instantly.He weighed somewhere a kilogram of two hundred, looked like a bun, was bald, and his eyes inspired only good and positive to anyone.He himself was not a bad guy, and in principle he was a guy.Something like this I can describe my reception.- Valera, our little angel fell in love!- said mom.“It never happened and here again,” said Valera and looked at the floor with a sad face .. “Yes, how quickly the children grow up ... Most recently you went to the kindergarten ... And then I found a bride for yourself ... A man, not that I am in my youth ... - Talk to my son, and I will go to work, my mother quickly said and went to another room to change clothes.“Again you go to work on your highway,” said Valera, “it would be better to find a normal job to feed your family!”“Who would say ...” the mother said quietly.After waiting for my mother’s departure, I stayed on one with my dad.Our dialogue was verbose, we said how to walk, look and speak.I listened very carefully to my foster dad, I understood in order to like the girls, I need to get a beautiful way and begin to ignore everyone except my love.I instantly asked my father money.Having received five hundred rubles, I went to the Beauty Negro beauty salon (google yourself, if you do not believe), usually I went to barbishops, but my father strictly said that only real men go to a white black man.Entering the salon, I immediately sat in a chair and prepared for a haircut.A few minutes later, a brutal man came up to me and finding out what kind of haircut I want, he laid down to business.I believe that only brutal alfomozhchina-ghosts that girls like can cut their hair.Because of this, I chose this hairstyle.On the same day, I decided that I had to act and invited my muse to the stadium, to drink the ball.I thought she would come alone ... But she came with her boyfriend.The muse sat and looked at us while I was kicking a ball with her boyfriend.Her guy went into the bushes, and, without wasting time, went to his passion and confessed her love to her ... To what she answered that she likes those who play the tanks ... After these words, her boyfriend came up and let me go, taking my sneakers with a Ronaldo's autograph, but this is another story ... I installed it home, I installed War Thunder on my powerful and game launcherDigma Eve 1401, which I bought in LeoMax, saving money from the dining room from 1 to 9 grade.After a few thousand fights, I realized that this is my favorite game and now the girls are not interested in ... special gratitude to such tankers as: Macron, Pavel Durov, anime series: sweet fat, mr.goida.Thank you, for teaching me how to play.\n",

      "1414/4320 | nan → This game is so not worth the time sink, it literally begs for money around every corner. Want a tank/aircraft that you genuinely want to play? Buy it for 70 euro. Want to progress your tree in a timely manner? Buy premium. Want to also add bushes to your tanks like those other annoying players? Buy golden eagles. It's such wasted potential, genuinely have no idea who gaijin thinks they are to be charging so much money for things you can experience in other games. DCS is free, and easily mod-able, unlike this game which feels underbaked despite having existed for 12 years as of writing this review. The gamemodes are incredibly repetitive and get old after your 6-8th game, the maps are poorly designed for tank combat, the game is incredibly unfair to F2P players and the PVE gamemodes are just awful. This game is not worth your time, it only exists to beg the player for money without providing any meaningful substance. I personally haven't bought a single paid feature in this game, but from seeing the reviews, there also seems to be a problem with the premium packages not even providing you to the items promised so there's that. If you have a good computer, just play DCS. If not, find something else. This game will do nothing for you, but enrage you until you eventually spend money on it.\n",

      "1619/4320 | 76561199426824296 → Product Receved for Free Good day, dear readers of the Gamer League community.The theme of the post will be a review of the online game \"War Thunder\".It turned out a lot of text, but I tried to make it interesting and most informative as possible.In any case - pleasant reading).But before starting, you should say a few words about the developers of this game.Which are \"Gaijin Entertainment\".The creators of the cult series of airplanes IL-2, Apache, as well as rather strange projects, such as Brotherhood and Ring, Boomer, Zhmurki, but in a decent society about these crafts of the Russian Gamdev, it is not customary to recall).The general description of “War Thunder” is an online game, a session type with elements of a simulator dedicated to military equipment, tank and aircraft simulator.The main idea of ​​which is the opportunity to play on one battlefield as well as ground equipment, so airy.The idea is not new, this can be found in the casual “Battlefield” and in the hardcore “Arma”.The difference is that in this game you control more than one fighter, but a full -fledged combat unit, whether it be a tank, a plane, a helicopter or ship.And even if they begin to destroy the crew, you will remain for some time a full -fledged combat unit on the battlefield, albeit with some restrictions.We smoothly move on to the chip that separates this game from other tank battles.- This is a model of damage.There are no such strips of health in the game, you want to destroy the enemy, be good to hit the modules or the crew.This gives the game some aspect of realism, but increases the threshold of entering the game.It will be difficult for a beginner who has not played the game, it will be difficult to understand that entering the enemy may not have any consequences for this.At the same time, an experienced player is easily capable of sending an unlucky player to the hangar from one well -aimed shot.On this note, we will move on to gameplay in more detail.The gameplay from the game -mechanical side of the gameplay in the game is the easiest - I found the enemy, shot, amazed, repeat, repeat to the victorious.But the game does not forgive mistakes, while not very encouraging the player.The gameplay begins to change, as you progress in the game, which does not let you get bored, but you always have to learn something new.If and Arkade requires the ability to quickly respond, painfully shoot, then for a realistic regime, you need to be able to find the enemy, calculate the distance to it and hit in a vital module, whether it is a warning or fuel tank.And for the simulator, in addition to all of the above, it is important to be able to recognize the technique, whether it is an ally or enemy, as well as if you are interested in aviation, be able to conduct air battle, be able to perform attacking and protective maneuvers and be able to assault unlucky tankers.Regardless of which mode of the game is closer to you, the game tries to maintain a certain pace.If at the beginning, the battles occur on wedges and biplans, then with the receipt of more modern technology, the pace begins to increase.On modern technology, the dynamics are completely different, tanks are worn like electric bars, all thermal imagers and various auxiliary systems.It is at this moment that the game is completely revealed, new mechanics are opening, which were not the previous time while playing on lower -ranking technique.Therefore, each player will find the pace of the game, which is most pleasant to him, and where he can show a good result.Who can this game attract?A person who enjoys military equipment.A person who is interested in aviation duels using the attacking and defensive maneuvers of the highest aerobatics.A person who wants to get excitement from a tank battle.The developers do everything for the sake of such players.If you know what is the difference between the MD-5 fuse from MD-8, or you know what Hummerhead is, then welcome !!!\n",

With this latest update the afterbattle hit analysis is not even working correctly, its simply does not want to show the questionable hits that should have penned and killed the enemy. And heres the thing about casino, the game does not reward you if you know the timings and the weak spots of the tanks, you can shoot 0 degree angle perfect front armor of the tank, dont pen it, and get oneshotted afterwards from a level 50 or below guy with 0.5kd. The game is very random and exhausting, map textures and work with lights are and makes it painful to play realistic battles mode where you need to find the tanks using your eyes. And dont forget about the grind, its so absurd that after 2000 hours (Ive played more on the launcher version than steam) of playing this game as a free to play player I have only reached 9.3 br for US and 10.3 for Sweden. The game is addicting and its the unending cycle of you trying to beat the game and prove him that you can \"outplay the game\" but in reality your sanity decreases proportionally with the time you put into this game. If you have life, friends, loving family and self love then don't play this game but even then you better off playing other games than this ass, random ass casino game that masks itself as a \"realistic vehicle game about war\". I love this game but I cant recommend it to anyone.\n",

      "1710/4320 | nan → From the moment I first encountered this so-called \"realistic military vehicle shooter game\" in 2017 to now, all I feel is disappointment—or rather, profound disappointment. From once trusting the official community to now being forced to face its discriminatory behavior, countless Chinese vehicle issues—even those backed by substantial evidence—are routinely dismissed, delayed, locked, or labeled as \"not a bug\" time and time again. Most Chinese players have lost all trust in War Thunder's official handling of the Chinese tech tree, whether it's with each update or the so-called \"never mistreated\" claims. The Chinese community's attitude toward their own nation's tech tree has become one of mockery, with phrases like \"hilarious 7.1,\" \"hilarious VT5,\" \"uniquely flavored J-11B,\" and \"distinctive PL-12\" being commonplace. Most Chinese players don’t care about the strength of the Russian tech tree or those of other nations. They simply hope to no longer be silenced and subjected to discriminatory treatment. I don’t expect the developers to acknowledge this or take any action—disappointment has long since set in. As of now, the viability of many Chinese vehicles is largely due to the efforts of the players themselves. For reference, one need only look at the recent efforts and performance of Chinese players in *Helldivers 2* during its latest event. 2017“” issuenot a bug“”“7.1”“VT5”“J11B”“PL-12” HellDivers2\n",

      "1770/4320 | 76561199683455152 → A quick explanation of War Thunder's problems: In theory, War Thunder (ground battles) is an engaging game with a novel idea and a focus on realism. Unfortunately, in real life, this game suffers from an array of issues. Consistency: Many basic and necessary game-play mechanics (especially regarding shell behaviour) are hopelessly inconsistent. From shells getting stuck on edges and thin bits of hotboxes, to just flying through enemy vehicles without causing any damage, this game can be endlessly infuriating. Some types of shells are also notoriously inconsistent, such as APDS or APCR which suffer from all of the afore mentioned issues plus shell shatter and inconsistent damage. Connection/Servers: This one really varies depending on who you ask, but everyone has at least one issue. For me, I randomly loose connection to whatever server I'm playing on every 10 games or so. This forces me to close and reopen the game every time to return to the match. It's gotten better recently, but instead it has been replaced by my packet loss spiking every now and then. I still don't know what causes it. Team spirit: War Thunder may seem like it would be the perfect game for cooperating and team-focused game-play, but this could not be further from the truth. Not only are the rewards for kill assists pitiful, but the rewards for playing on the winning team have been nerfed. All of this culminates in a toxic team experience, especially at higher tiers. Kill sealing is common practice in war thunder. Premiums: The main reason people begin playing this game is to get a Top Tier Vehicle, but often don't realise it will take the average player years to grind your way to the top. When players give up on the tech-tree grind they will usually buy a $70 premium only for them get clapped at top tier. This fills top tier with new and inexperienced players who only hinder their more experienced teammates (not me, I'm kinda stupid). Seal Clubbing: For anyone starting off, please be aware that you might come across a high level player dominating low tiers. Most of the time, they are just helping a friend learn the ropes or they simply enjoy low tier. On occasion these players are trying to improve their player stats by playing against new players. Don't get angry at them, just remember, they are only here because they are at their own battle rating. Close air support(CAS) and Self-Propelled Anti-Air(SPAA): In ground realistic battles, every player has the ability to spawn and control their own plane, helicopter and/or drone. This allows players to bomb, strafe, fire rockets and/or missiles as (usually) defenceless players. I wouldn't have a problem with this if it wasn't so easy to spawn in CAS. When a player only needs to kill one other player to spawn in a fully loaded dive bomber, there is effectively nothing you can do to prevent getting bombed. Additionally, the deterrent for CAS, SPAA is notoriously unrewarding giving no currency for shooting down CAS. Why I still play: I know I've rambled on for a long time, but to be honest this game provides a truly unique experience to all other games and if you ignore it's endless issues and controversy, it can be very fun. I mainly play this game for the satisfaction, since watching a king tiger's turret fly off into space after an ammorack is more enjoyable than anything I have ever experienced in any other game. I'd like to hear some other players thoughts on these issues. With that said, War Thunder is not a game for those who lose their sh*t easily. p.s. I know steam says I've only played ~4.8 hours, but I'm a level 50 who has grinded 90% of the German Tech-Tree and 40% of the American Tech-Tree\n",

Don't feed the snail. Gaijin should thank us for playing their game, not the other way around.

      "1840/4320 | 76561198007399587 → Gaijin can best be described as predatory, lazy and incredibly incompetent. They receive an obscene amount of money from a predatory game design practices. They will intentionally nerf a vehicle to encourage you to buy the premium tanks which are also outrageously priced. They do not spend any effort or time on QoL, map design, game design, etc. You will fight on a tiny map over a chalk circle. These maps also highly encourage players to spawn camp. So much so that some maps you can see each other as you are leaving your respective spawns. There is a SIGNIFICANT amount of \"trust\" as it relates to specs of russian tanks and aircraft and sometimes outright lies but Gaijin is super skeptical of NATO equipment specs and most of the time they don't even model the tanks based off of the published specifications for the tanks anyways to ensure Russian player supremacy. For example, NATO nations can fly an MQ-1 during Ground Realistic Battles, but since Russia has no MQ-1 equivalent, they gave Russia and China their equivalent of an MQ-9 which is a significant jump in tech. Russian T series tanks will be penetrated in their auto loader and you will see their carousel of ammo explode but the crew lives, the tank will drive, and still shoot and load, despite you seeing them ignite inside. The Russian premium 2S38 shows it can penetrate a small-modest amount of armor but it consistently pens through the thickets armor in the game far beyond its battle rating. Ground Realistic Battles are nothing but Russian CAS simulators where broken and neutered NATO AA can do nothing to stop the highly buffed SU30 spam. Russian players will join the game, get 1 kill, and immediately spend the rest of the game in an aircraft racking up 10-15 kills easily winning the game.. in a game where it's supposed to be about tanks.. Bottom line, if you want to be gaslit to spend 100's of real like dollars toward a company that intentionally breaks their game to encourage you to spend money, then go for it.\n",

Gaijin is continuously pushing the boundaries and testing the limits of its players. If you are familiar with the game \"Escape from Tarkov,\" you probably know the consequences when game developers constantly provoke their player base. As players of this game, we contribute to its activity, and in theory, Gaijin should appreciate each and every one of us who continues to support and encourage this game. However, Gaijin keeps pushing the boundaries and exploiting each and every one of us. This recent economic change is not just a simple adjustment, Gaijin is gradually making it clear that if you don't pay for this game, you don't deserve to play it.I implore every player here to bravely stand up and resist this behavior. Gaijin has now infringed upon our rights as players, and we cannot, and should not, let Gaijin continue to exploit us in the future. It is time for us players to unite and stand together. We should be a collective, a class, opposing Gaijin's exploitation and oppression towards us. We are here to enjoy this game, to find joy in it, and we should not be working for Gaijin.1 hope that each player will save and spread this message. This post will undoubtedly be deleted, but we should copy it, share it, on any platform, anywhere that allows us to make our voices heard. Fellow warriors\n",

      "1991/4320 | 76561198010308417 → Playing this game is like being in abusive relationship. You give and give, but WT always needs more and more. What is especially egregious is the grind for Rank V+ vehicles. It is asinine. To add insult to injury, after you do unlock that vehicle you spent 20-40 hrs grinding for (at least honestly), you have to cough up truly inordinate amounts of Silver Lions to (1) buy the vehicle, and (2) qualify your crew for that vehicle. That just puts things over the edge for me. This practice is greedy, it is abusive, and you are better off spending your time on real world things. Or literally anything else. To get any satisfaction from upper tier gameplay, this game forces you to treat it like a second job, one in which YOU give IT your time and money. Such an arrangement really isn't healthy at all. That being said, the game can be very fun once you get the hang of things. And on the technical side, the devs honestly should be lauded for much of their work. The in-game economy is where the grubby hands of management are apparent. I would simply advise one to play WT casually. Do NOT let it suck you in. Enjoy the Rank 1 to 4 grind, which is fairly pleasant and fast. Just be sure to listen to that nagging feeling when you get that sticker shock for the first time -- it only gets worse, and you're better off spending your time elsewhere from that point.\n",

      "2058/4320 | nan → Where do I even begin with this dumpster fire of a game? Unacceptable Grind: The grind in this game is beyond ridiculous. It’s like the devs are actively trying to frustrate you. Every single vehicle upgrade feels like it takes a lifetime, and no matter how much you play, it always feels like you're just scraping the surface. The whole system is designed to get you to spend money, and it's painfully obvious. Rockets Don’t Work: Why is it that when I use rockets, they either miss or just don’t lock on properly? It’s like they’re rigged to fail. But as soon as other players launch their rockets, they hit with pinpoint accuracy every single time. This game has some serious issues with consistency and balancing. Other Players’ Rockets Are Unstoppable: Don’t even get me started on how every rocket fired by the enemy is like a heat-seeking missile that never misses. Meanwhile, my rockets constantly lose lock or just fail to track. It's completely one-sided and feels unfair. Everything Is Expensive: The in-game packs and premium content are ridiculously overpriced. It's like they expect you to drop hundreds of dollars just to keep up with the grind. Want a faster progression? Pay up. Want a better vehicle? Pay up. It's honestly insulting. Countermeasures Are a Joke: Oh, and the countermeasures? They’re essentially useless. If the enemy even flashes their countermeasures, your rocket loses lock. Yet, for some reason, when I use countermeasures, it never seems to work in my favor. Overall, this game is nothing more than a money grab, and it’s riddled with bugs and unbalanced mechanics. Save yourself the headache and don’t even bother downloading it. War Thunder is a complete disaster and will only leave you frustrated and broke. The devs (Gaijin) clearly don’t care, and this game has become an absolute joke.\n",

I bet in reality nobody will do such an anti-air load. Totally biased , unbearable ignorance from devs. Bias russian MBTs, su-30sm, every patch. Devs claiming they re not into politics, keeping adding russian warfare fighting in war now, but never will add ukrainian vehicles, which are same as russian post-soviet projects. Its too political for them you know. It is biased russian weaponry advertisment game. Ahhh. Dont forget monthly russian propaganda events honorable russians celebrate 80th anniversary ww2 with putin, celebrate international cosmonautics(soviet made celebration, later they changed post to be international day of space flight as in rest of the world). They make events for russia even forgetting to adopt. And Z, ZOV propaganda nicknames and clanes (spoiler: they wont get banned, NEVER) If you want fund biased russian game, play and donate. Otherwise forget this . Nobody even cares about map rotation, such basic feature. You can play only 1 map 20 times in raw complete evening. Bias making game even worse.

It's so frustrating, most of the times you lose by far, with your spawn being overrun and obv getting killed the second you decide to give the round another try. Should you win 1 in 5 games (and that's getting lucky) it's not fun either cause the enemy can't even put up a fight.

This game is all frustration and no fun. Whatever you do: stay away from it. this games is no fun as this is not really a game. It is a frustration simulator. especially for new players. EDIT: Flying is kinda okay though as most enemies cant aim precise enough with all the movement going on for killing you instantly and not being able to fly with a tail or wing missing makes sense. But for tank crews to be oneshot feels really weird and it gets worse the further up you go into the techtree.

Just going from a Tiger Tank to a King Tiger or Tiger II is 63,000 Research Points , i get about 1,000 if im lucky a game , the cost of buying the King Tiger would make me broke and unable to train my crew for it.

I honestly dont think i want to comeback to this game , no matter what nation i play and being hard stuck because the grind got so long that it could take days to weeks just to get a single new tank and then be stuck playing the same tank 50 to 100 more matches for the next new tank and then repeat. ive spaded every single tank going up to 5.7 germany because the grind took so long and still dont have a Tiger II or even my first leopard tank\n",

Gaijin is continuously pushing the boundaries and testing the limits of its players. If you are familiar with the game \"Escape from Tarkov,\" you probably know the consequences when game developers constantly provoke their player base. As players of this game, we contribute to its activity, and in theory, Gaijin should appreciate each and every one of us who continues to support and encourage this game. However, Gaijin keeps pushing the boundaries and exploiting each and every one of us. This recent economic change is not just a simple adjustment, Gaijin is gradually making it clear that if you don't pay for this game, you don't deserve to play it.I implore every player here to bravely stand up and resist this behavior. Gaijin has now infringed upon our rights as players, and we cannot, and should not, let Gaijin continue to exploit us in the future. It is time for us players to unite and stand together. We should be a collective, a class, opposing Gaijin's exploitation and oppression towards us. We are here to enjoy this game, to find joy in it, and we should not be working for Gaijin.1 hope that each player will save and spread this message. This post will undoubtedly be deleted, but we should copy it, share it, on any platform, anywhere that allows us to make our voices heard. Fellow warriors\n",

Tell me why, when I want to play 7.3, i get up-tiered to fight 8.3? ON TOP OF THAT, every new major update for 3 years has added some form of game-breaking bug that is not even patched for, in some cases, MONTHS. Currently, the newest update has been the worst so far. They only really added a FEW interesting new vehicles, and most were premium. And there has been so many bugs that the game is virtually unplayable sometimes. For example, why does twin 23mm and a 37mm gun, using HE BELTS, hitting a thin sheet metal aircraft, do nothing? Because the devs somehow BROKE HE BELTS FOR ALL AIRCRAFT. It is so frustrating, and the fact that these awful updates are only going to continue makes me sick.

And the only planes you have are early 1940's fighter's, whereas the enemy has late 1950's jets, and enough CAS to make the battle for Normandy a \"cool Breeze\". You yourself, can get into a plane very should you get 1 kill, 2 assists, or a capture. And these all include your death as well. Because its fun when you can get into a plane for only 140 Spawn points. Other things of note, Battle rating is dumb, excessively dumb. I'm talking \"i bring a single jet into air arcade and can now fight all prop planes\" You think this isn't real, and yet it WILL HAPPEN if you play 4.0 planes. People using the tier system to their advantage so they can jump into a down tier game and beat the absolute piss outta the local 80 year old grandma on her nintendo wii. Further more the tier system itself is garbage. Lets Pair 1940's equipment to Russian bmp's, i see no problem here! Oh wait, Half the bmp's we're fighting have a single missile or TOW capabilities and so we don't stand a chance against fast maneuverable Stew warmers.

      "2229/4320 | 76561199213694119 → This game is anything but realistic. It is a money pit. It might as well be World of Tanks with slightly better physics and no health bars. It has to many prototype vehicles and project vehicles that are overpowered because of the \"What if\". If they were so good then they would have been in service but most were failures. Why do I want to play vehicle where only two examples ever existed and never saw combat or left the garage? World of Tanks can have their fun with the \"what if\" tanks. I wish Gaijin wouldn't make War Thunder the polished turd version of WoT. Further, the developers never listen to the player base as whole, only the few cry babies who nerf anything NATO. Further, War Thunder's non-political bias is a lie as Russian vehicles and munitions are often superior to anything NATO when real life has shown that the Russian are behind the curve. It doesn't help when they refuse to add certain NATO munitions that would balance out the playing field because they don't want to hurt their Russian -main player base. Also considering they are based in Hungary which has a pro-Kremlin sentiment, doesn't help their case either. Many of their employees are Russian as well which again, doesn't help.\n",

I know damned well you got some seriously good talent of developers so I know damned well you can stick the 1940's WW2 era tanks, planes, and ship with the same vehicles. I'm pretty good at this game, that is untill I'm getting killed by Vietnam, Cold war era tanks. Imagine your rolling around a Tiger 1 or King Tiger tank and you come face to face with coaxle missile carrying tanks, or better yet you come face to face with a generation 1 Abrams. What in the hell Giajin? And it is definitely a pay to win platform. If you spend the money to get a vehicle you're pretty much going to dominate the battle field, untill you meet an opponent that has spent the same money themselves, then they're cooked. Like I said Im pretty decent at the game, but it is very frustrating fighting Bradley's, and Abrams tanks in a WW2 era tank. If that's not biased then I dont know what is. I mean damn Giajin there seems to be a consensus that the \"balancing\" and maps are small, open your damned eyes for once and read the damned comments.\n",

      "2276/4320 | 76561198006722366 → War Thunder is really tempting with it's honestly quite fun modeling and control set ups, but it has two major flaws that make it impossible to recommend. In short' it's designed to be frustrating, and as a result of this the actual game design is extremely barebones, with all design work being focused on \"content\" that ends up being a struggle to enjoy. First, the game is designed primarily to be addictive and to monetize player frustration. This makes it a real struggle to genuinely enjoy playing it. The UI and \"research\" mechanics are designed to force you to think about what vehicle you want to unlock, rather than what vehicle you want to play, so instead of playing the game and enjoying the vehicles you play, the game pushes you to always be thinking about what you're grinding for, effectively turning gameplay into an obstacle rather than.. you know, fun. Fun can be found, although you often have to fight the design of the game and the game usually actively punishes you for doing so. Second, and as a result, the actual game design is extremely lacking. There is effectively no single-player gameplay - what is technically there is frankly an embarrassment of shoddy game design that is neither enjoyable nor rewarding, and seems to only exist so that ads for the game can list \"single player campaigns\". The only multiplayer that exists usually just devolves into deathmatch PvP because the mechanics of the multiplayer modes are so extremely basic and arcadey. It's sad, because there's almost a great game here; with the engine, the modeling, and all the technical side of things. But the gameplay is intentionally designed to be exploitative of the player. I still rack up hours in it. It can be fun to approach your vehicles as you would plastic models. Ultimately though, as a *game*? It's not a good game.\n",

Mechanics of voluminous shells and voluminous pressure often work far from the way they need, but these are mechanics that have a significant impact on the gameplay (hello comet tower, which, due to ended geometry, eats shells that should break through it, but they are confused in the complex relief of the tower) 3. RPU (the regime of personal oppression)-they will not bring money and you will suffer from eternal, you will suffer from eternal, you will suffer.You will be in the point 4.

      "2413/4320 | nan → War Thunder is one of the most comprehensive and immersive military vehicle combat games available today. It offers a deep, ever-expanding experience across air, land, and sea—featuring a huge variety of realistic vehicles from World War II through the modern era. Whether you're into dogfighting in the skies, commanding massive tanks, or launching naval assaults, War Thunder gives you the tools to do it all, and it does so with incredible attention to detail. The game is unique in how it caters to both casual and hardcore players. It offers multiple game modes, from arcade-style battles for fast-paced fun to realistic and simulator modes for players who want true-to-life combat and tactical depth. Controls and physics scale with your chosen level of realism, making it accessible for newcomers but endlessly rewarding for veterans. The sheer variety of content is staggering—over 2,000 historically accurate aircraft, tanks, helicopters, and naval vessels from nations around the world. Each vehicle feels distinct, and many have unique roles and capabilities that encourage experimentation and strategic thinking. Customization is also rich, allowing you to upgrade parts, camouflage, armaments, and crew skills. One of the game's strongest features is the combined arms combat. Few games offer the thrill of flying air support over a tank battle, coordinating strikes with teammates, or dodging flak while trying to line up the perfect bombing run. It all happens in large, dynamic maps that require coordination and situational awareness, especially in the more realistic modes. The visuals and sound design are impressive. Vehicles look authentic, terrain and weather effects add immersion, and the sound of engines roaring or cannons thundering feels weighty and visceral. The game continues to evolve with regular updates, new tech trees, and community events that keep it fresh and engaging. Why I recommend it: I highly recommend War Thunder to players who enjoy tactical combat, vehicle realism, and deep progression. It rewards both quick reflexes and thoughtful planning, whether you're chasing air superiority, dominating ground battles, or launching sea-based offensives. It’s not just a war game—it’s a living history sandbox that continues to grow with its community. Whether you're a history buff, a sim fan, or someone who just loves epic battles and unlocking powerful new gear, War Thunder delivers a thrilling, expansive, and rewarding experience unlike anything else out there. And best of all—it's free to play, so you can jump in and see the action for yourself.\n",

The maps are unbalanced, the teams are unbalanced, you will ALWAYS get up-tiered (against enemies who are in higher tier tanks than you), you will never got down-tiered. Mathematically it's not even possible that everyone gets up-tiered all the time, and yet somehow War Thunder achieves it. Oh and uh, as joked about above, you will do absolutely no damage to anyone, whilst everyone else always manages to one shot you, or at least hit you in a critical location despite the fact they shouldn't have been able to hit you there. Don't think that getting later-game tanks with better armour helps, it doesn't, you will still get one shot across the map. The game is also ludicrously buggy - you will just hit random invisible objects in the middle of major roads, things will have hitboxes 100x the size of the visible object or have no hitbox at all, your tank turret will just randomly bounce just as you're about to shoot someone, even though you never even moved. This game is horrendously bad. It's been out for 12 years and still plays and looks like it's in pre-alpha. Avoid at all costs.\n",

      "2422/4320 | 76561198017435030 → I am just another bad review in all of this. even though steam only says I have 7 hours played I have close to 1,500 hours on the game. I love historical planes and tanks that's why I started playing in the first place but all it is, is just a time and money pit. You might have fun playing at first but a month later and you most likely won't even be 1/16 through the tech tree. If you buy a premium vehicle you are confined to it and if you play for free you never make progress. Worst off all is Air RB, you will be told nothing and will constantly be destroyed by OP planes. Jets are reserved for two types of people those who have no life out side of this game and those who pay 70$ to mindlessly shoot missles. My only word of advice is play at your own risk.\n",

Please, Hell i'll even go as far to say if you want fun just play world or warships, world of tanks, or something else for planes since idk one that's good for it. So yeah just don't play this please because playing it and giving the devs money only means that they will see the money made and thus their greed will grow, And heck i might as well say this, i wouldn't be surprised if most or some of the good reviews are from the premium players just paying to make it easier to win, And basically just guaranteeing that they get one shots, But i am new so i'll give it a few more chances before i fully confirm this so i'll probably add an edit later. Edit: Yeah i was right like it just snowballs until you die like the devs could've at least made respawns infinite instead of limited that way you can keep trying at least. (And heck i'm starting to think that the score thing to balance skill is not functional since it seems to work based on your most powerful vehicle so i think good premium players are just getting rid of thier good tanks and then making the game hell for new players, But hey that's just a theory, A STEAM THEORY!)\n",

Gaijin is continuously pushing the boundaries and testing the limits of its players. If you are familiar with the game \"Escape from Tarkov,\" you probably know the consequences when game developers constantly provoke their player base. As players of this game, we contribute to its activity, and in theory, Gaijin should appreciate each and every one of us who continues to support and encourage this game. However, Gaijin keeps pushing the boundaries and exploiting each and every one of us. This recent economic change is not just a simple adjustment, Gaijin is gradually making it clear that if you don't pay for this game, you don't deserve to play it.I implore every player here to bravely stand up and resist this behavior. Gaijin has now infringed upon our rights as players, and we cannot, and should not, let Gaijin continue to exploit us in the future. It is time for us players to unite and stand together. We should be a collective, a class, opposing Gaijin's exploitation and oppression towards us. We are here to enjoy this game, to find joy in it, and we should not be working for Gaijin.1 hope that each player will save and spread this message. This post will undoubtedly be deleted, but we should copy it, share it, on any platform, anywhere that allows us to make our voices heard. Fellow warriors\n",

First i'll give my opinion on the state of the game, and then my personal reason as to why im uninstalling war thunder after this review. War Thunder is truly a unique game. You will not find another mil-sim style game with such attention to detail, vast amount of playable vehicles, and cinematic graphics while also being somewhat user friendly. Other mil-sims like DCS and ARMA are comparable to war thunder in terms of graphics and attention to detail yet not nearly as gamified for the masses. For these reasons the game is enticing to people who like military vehicles and action filled game play but also don't want to learn the in depth controls of an f-18. As far as game play goes, its a mixed bag. The grind is soul sucking, and it can take months to unlock top tier vehicles, even with premium enabled. As such, if your only interested in playing end line vehicles be prepared to drop 80 bucks or play 50 games a day for a month. What made the grind negligible for me for so long was that the game play at its roots, is fun. Every time you one shot a tank its like doing a line because of all the effects. TL/DR, the game is fun if you don't mind learning a little. I've been addicted to war thunder for 5+ years. Not playing, addicted. I say this because WT is something that really took a large time out of my life which was detrimental to my ability to socialize with friends outside of school and learn real life skills. If I balanced my time better maybe it wouldn't have been so bad. However, uninstalling is the only way to get rid of the urges to play. This is why im not recommending this game, so no poor soul gets sucked into this game as I have. If you do get the game though, use with caution, hour a day max. Onto the next chapter.\n",

Now this is mainly about Air Arcade and also a personal impression i have, but matchmaking and actual ingame matches looks pretty rigged. Sometimes you're doing pretty good and you start getting 10 matches in a roll where half+ of your team quits because matchmaking put all them \"mono-jets\" dudes on the same side. Another side effect of premium. Or when you pop someone's wings off, promptly sending it into an unrecoverable spin, and you are awarded with a \"critical\", therefore a \"kill assist\" if anyone taps said jet.

All problems do not even need to look for them on the surface.One battle is enough in each mode and everything is immediately visible (3 fights).In addition, if any player with experience can not ask this and any few hours will be able to list problems.I did not call everything, since there are as many problems as many days to the game.Do not finish the guys and delete the game if you can go to another project.P.S.Even in the bunker on which the outfits were laid, bugs will be fixed a week, even if there are few content, but they do only in the bunker to bring the content to change one single card every year, it is much more time -consuming (a couple of people and a couple of months to allocate) do not have such restrictions on how much you want cards if you don’t care about all the better cards.Wardaner what one disabled in Painte does.\n",

The main reason(s) I can't recommend this game is that it seems to genuinely punish new players, especially with the abysmal matchmaking. Me at level 10 constantly getting \"up-tiered\" and pitted against level 100's that know every map and where to shoot your tank to one shot you. Insanely frustrating gameplay, we played mostly \"Ground Realistic Battles\" which seemed like it would focus around just tanks- nope. Planes rule that mode and it's just not fun at all. One major problem is of course the free to play but pay to win aspect; couldn't count how many times I was killed by \"Premium\" vehicles that I couldn't hurt with the base vehicles but was easily killed by. Anyway, I will say a few positives (that are simply overshadowed by gameplay): excellent sound design, sound of the shots were very powerful. The details on each tank\\vehicle are impressive, from rivets and welds to cables and guns, so it's cool to look at the vehicles and see them up close.

      "2827/4320 | nan → If you are thinking abut playing this game because you heard it's good and realistic game or simply you like tanks then let me warn you, you will be disappointed. You are always fighting against better tanks - either premium tanks bought with real money or simply higher level tanks, most common gamemode is \"ground realistic battles\" where you play with ground vehicles.. and planes. Your typical experience will be driving for few mintues only to get hit by a bomb from plane. And last but not least is P2W. In order to progress you need premium account which is a subscription or buy a premium tanks which are stronger versions of normal vehicles you can get for free, otherwise you will be stuck to slow prgression and often weak tanks. When it comes to ships I have zero experience, I have played it few times and couldn't understand what the hell is going on.

The planes.. and revenge bombers.. if shooting down planes gave lots of rewards, the planes could be tolerated, but alas.. And I like how in certain maps, there are areas within the boundary of the map that you can't go for some reason, and yet spawn camping is encouraged. Your enemy can steamroll to your base, and you have merely seconds of spawn protection before got obliterated by the enemy tanks or planes Frustrating battles most of the time.

There is no level balancing so u fight players four times your level and you constantly get uptiers with tanks you can not compete with. The russian tech tree is one of the most overpowered things in warthunder due to the development team being russian of course. Everything should be reworked, br, uptiers, downtiers and balancing. The maps feel unbearable with only 2-4 maps being good. Progress is slow without a premium account and it will take almost a month to unlock one tank above 6.7 with daily playing. Each time i play this i fight level 100 players that spent 10000 hours in this game which are not supposed to be at my br and i die in the first 3 minutes of the game. Even premium vehicles wont save you. I bought the Turm 3 pack and each time i went in a game i got 1 or 2 kills and got sent back to the hangar which only gives you around 3k research points if you do as good as that or better without a premium account. Do not download this game at any cost if you are not willing to spend 2000 plus hours to reach high tiers and constant suffering. Do not download this game. I do not recommend it to anyone except those who are willing to spend those imaginable amount of hours in this piece of game.\n",
      "2830/4320 | 76561199146913324 → Product received for free \"War Thunder: Great Combat Buried Under a Mountain of Greed\" War Thunder delivers stunning visuals, immersive sound, and some of the most engaging air and ground combat you’ll find in any game. But all of that brilliance is buried under one of the most predatory economic systems in gaming. The rank system forces you to buy aircraft you neither want nor will ever use—often at inflated prices—just to unlock the one you actually want. The aircraft themselves are absurdly expensive, and the rewards after each battle are so poor it feels like the game is punishing you for playing. Repair costs are outrageously high, ammunition prices sometimes rival or exceed the profit from an entire match, and the Silver Lion rewards barely cover a fraction of these expenses. Even the Convertible RP system is just another cash grab, since you can’t use it without spending Golden Eagles. Gaijin has taken what could have been the best free-to-play combat experience and turned it into a relentless money extraction machine, where planes and tanks are just tools to milk the player base. Instead of feeling like a pilot or tank commander, you end up a wage slave in a filthy in-game economy designed to eat your time and your wallet.\n",

We need more decrompression at tanks and Planes (F.e a Br that goes up to 17.0-18.0). There are missiles and Planes that need changes and im sick of it always just getting a little good and a lot of bad things in new updates. Even though there are all these negatives I do still think this game is a good game. The Models and amount of vehicles is incredible and the different tactics and playstyles are great. The Weapons and Guns feel great and the amount of variebility is really one of a kind. But it is a really frustrating game to get into and especially if you want to get good at it, the randomness will stop you. So for casual players i wouldnt say its a good game.\n",
      "2837/4320 | 76561198031845320 → i recommend the game.. up until around BR 6.3. Espacially in the BR-range from 7-9 you will most likely meat opponents, who abuse the BR system and use planes, with missles, while you don't have any in your complete loadout at all. Gaijin doesn't give a damn about it, on the contrary they encourage you to abuse this system with premium planes, which clearly do not belong in those BR. Every game with 8.0 or above you have at least one person with a MIG-21, which is about twice as fast as every other plane in the lobby, climbs thrice as fast and has missles which can even lock on head on in some models, while you still have guns and cannons. Clearly there needs to be an option, where you can toggle missle-/non-missle-lobbies, to tackle this problem. It would make it fair and more fun for most players. They could also simply uptier these stupid MIG-21s (there is at least 3 of them (!!!), because they clearly don't belong in the same lobby as planes which barely scratch 1000 km/h top speed and have no missles, but they don't give a damn because of the sweet money those abusers give them. It's sad, because it's such an interesting era of aviation and they ruin the fun for ~80-90% of the players of this BR\n",

First of all, it is not a team game, team play is never something you will get help with. if you have anyone else on your team willing to attack the same thing as you it's always a coincedence. they WILL call you slurs if you get the majority of a cap they were going for/kill someone who was tearing them to shreds.

My problem with it is Gaijin never doing anything about bug reports and incorrect stats even when plenty of proof is shown to back up the claims (Example being Spookston with the HSTVL and RDLFT) Obvious Russian bias towards the game. Examples being very strong vehicles being at lower BR's where they are unfairly strong compared to the other vehicles in that br bracket, good example being T-55AMD with a stab, thermals, APFSDS, APS all while being in the same BR bracket as the AMX-30 (No stab, no thermals, no APFSDS) Just an overall biased experience when it comes to Russian vehicles and equipment.\n",

Meanwhile, I’m driving my 1980s MBT that gets penned through the barrel by some prototype that probably never left a drawing board. I feel like some war thunder devs family got blown by an abrams IRL so there main goal was to f*ck the tank over in a virtual video game so for example like not adding the Depleted uranium to the Abrams. Why does some no-name 3rd world nation have better stabilizers, better rounds, better reloads, better armor, better everything? I'm fighting fictional vehicles while driving real American . Gaijin has a weird obsession with nerfing America like it personally offends them. It’s honestly starting to feel racist how bad the bias is. America invented half this tech — but nah, let’s give it to random nations that couldn’t build a sandwich let alone a tank. Gaijin balancing is literally just \"America OP? Nerf. Other nation OP?

      "2859/4320 | 76561199096311252 → a realistic game that focus on realism to much, this game is amazing and i love how realistic it can be at times but its also one of its worst traits and quality when it comes to arcade this is because you can get one shot or blatantly have your ass handed to you in the dumbest of ways possible in arcade. if i wanted a super realistic play i would play the realistic game mode but in playing both of them i notice very few differences and that is a horrible problem to have, if anything ground arcade is the worst of the two and this i feel mainly applies to the tank aspect of the game not to mention some horrible i mean horrible map making and some very bias feeling tanks in certain areas. but truthfully i don't want to be able and i don't want have the ability to both one shot a player and be one shot my self in ground arcade. this also makes the game a much worst grind then it already is to get to higher tank levels. all in all if you want to play this game it might be better to stay away from the tanks as currently and for the for see able future it is sadly one of the worst parts of this game due to how they have made the maps and the game-play loop.\n",

But the company behind it — Gaijin — is one of the most out-of-touch, anti-consumer game studios I’ve ever encountered. They seem hellbent on sabotaging their own creation through broken updates, rigged matchmaking, and predatory monetization. Every patch feels like a new experiment in how much worse the experience can get. It’s like watching someone repeatedly shoot their own foot and blame the players for limping. Moderation is a joke. Gaijin enforces rules like it’s a dice roll — vague, inconsistent, and dependent on whether your opinion lines up with theirs. They’ve recently updated their Terms of Service to allow full account deletion if you don’t log in for 3 years — even if you’ve spent hundreds of dollars. That’s not just shady. That’s absurd. At this point, the developers seem less like people trying to improve a game and more like tired interns playing Jenga with the code. Every change feels rushed and untested. War Thunder could’ve been the gold standard of military combat sims. Instead, it’s held hostage by a company that treats its community like disposable income sources. If you value your time, money, or sanity — stay far, far away. Final score: 0/10, brought to you by whoever thought this was a sustainable business model.\n",

Sucking every single penny they can out of paying customers for every single thing you can imagine. Now lets talk about flying.. You'd expect the arcade mode to at least use some kind of controller input, dual analog perhaps or flight sticks to feel like a real fighter pilot game.. It doesn't. They have created some kind of dumbed down, mouse aim mode which is META and if you don't use it, you will be absolutely destroyed by even novice players.

You simply buy a better vehicle than other players. A vehicle that cannot be obtained by playing. It can only be bought with money. But that’s not all. The game's pay-to-win monetization doesn’t end there. Once you reach rank 5 or 6, the game starts using another tactic. Since you’ve already gotten a bit hooked, now welcome to hell. If you don’t spend money, forget about progressing any further. The game is over for you. But all this pay-to-win stuff is still nothing — maybe at least the game itself is good? Well, no. Leaving aside the pay-to-win machines, or as they call them, 'premium,' some vehicles are just completely unbalanced. But not in the sense that they’re too powerful. Oh no, no. Completely the opposite! The game has to frustrate you so that you’ll spend money. For example, at BR 9.0–9.3 in air battles, it’s completely unplayable. Take the J32B as an example. 37 matches played. 37 full uptiers to 10.3 (SIC!). You’re flying some piece of junk from the 1950s with AIM-9Bs that can barely hit a target flying straight from a kilometer away, and you’re up against MiG-21s with R-60Ms and Mirages with Magic 1s.

Start with new accounts through Steam: take bonuses for beginners: premium equipment, silver, accelerators and stickers - just go through Steam and activate promotional proposals.3. Tank life hack: Do not carry full ammunition - if they explode, there will be a fireworks.Disconnect the grass in the sight (settings → “Disable the grass in the sight”) - the enemies are visible much better.Always hide the case, show only the tower (so you live longer).4. A cool feature click on the enemy in binoculars - your tower itself will be visited, aiming will become easier.Use protective maneuvers and hit vulnerable places (protection analysis directly in the hangar).5. Do not join the already active battles: the mood in the options, in order to always start from scratch.Give the time to study tools, crew and upgrades of technology.Even a top tank without pumping is a useless piece of iron.Test any car at the training ground!6: Put the tags (assign a separate key) and always play in touch with the detachment - this really solves the outcome!I hope this will help you at least.Good luck in the battlefield!\n",

It's like bringing a cheeseburger to a gunfight!! And don’t even get me started on the GRIND. Worse than a CNN interview.

I downloaded again, but i never finished the download since then. At some point in my life i want to actually play the game and enjoy. But until then, I download, let steam queue it up at 5am and wait for it to finish.

      "3150/4320 | 76561199406677605 → To be honest, this games difficulty is quite intermediate the controls of tanks are simply easier than planes since you just load, fire and scout or simply hit and run in a smaller vehicle. While planes you have almost the same speed as your op, so running wasn't that easy also you have to memorize more keybinds especially when you're using a jet in a top tier match ex: countermeasures. You can learn evasive maneuvers if you're good enough it takes time. If you want to reach top tier you have to grind for hours or simply just buy your way top if you're rich. I recommend playing with a friend for a better experience.\n",

      "3339/4320 | 76561199243828094 → ABRBSBGaijin Gaijin To all the players of War Thunder:I believe everyone has noticed the recent changes in the in-game economy, whether it's for naval, ground, air battles, AB, RB, or SB. Gaijin is continuously pushing the boundaries and testing the limits of its players. If you are familiar with the game \"Escape from Tarkov,\" you probably know the consequences when game developers constantly provoke their player base. As players of this game, we contribute to its activity, and in theory, Gaijin should appreciate each and every one of us who continues to support and encourage this game. However, Gaijin keeps pushing the boundaries and exploiting each and every one of us. This recent economic change is not just a simple adjustment, Gaijin is gradually making it clear that if you don't pay for this game, you don't deserve to play it.I implore every player here to bravely stand up and resist this behavior. Gaijin has now infringed upon our rights as players, and we cannot, and should not, let Gaijin continue to exploit us in the future. It is time for us players to unite and stand together. We should be a collective, a class, opposing Gaijin's exploitation and oppression towards us. We are here to enjoy this game, to find joy in it, and we should not be working for Gaijin.1 hope that each player will save and spread this message. This post will undoubtedly be deleted, but we should copy it, share it, on any platform, anywhere that allows us to make our voices heard. Fellow warriors\n",

      "3360/4320 | nan → War Thunder is an exceptional combat simulation game that masterfully brings together the three major theaters of war—land, air, and sea into one seamless and immersive experience. This ambitious integration sets it apart from most military games, offering players the opportunity to engage in tank battles, dogfights, and naval warfare all within a single platform. One of the game’s strongest features is its stunning graphical detail. Vehicles, landscapes, weather effects, and explosions are rendered with an impressive level of realism, drawing players deep into the battlefield. Every tank tread, aircraft engine, and battleship turret looks and feels authentic, which greatly enhances immersion. The physics engine is equally impressive. The way vehicles move, fire, and take damage reflects real-world mechanics, making gameplay both challenging and rewarding. Whether you're diving from the sky in a fighter jet, navigating through waves in a destroyer, or holding ground in a heavy tank, the controls feel weighty and believable.\n",

      "3429/4320 | nan → For a game marketed as a \"combat simulator\" it sure feels RNG-heavy. In ground battles, it is clear modules are damaged based on a RNG model. One hit can result in a one-shot-kill while the same hit can simply do nothing. Same shell, range, enemy tank, etc., the only variable is the outcome. It feels like gambling and is dangerously addictive as a result. \"Target Destroyed\" is all you will be chasing, and the game WILL take advantage of this fact (see RNG-based damage, which is used to frustrate players). Additionally, this game offers no 'ground-only' battles: you will be pitted against helicopters and jets, hopelessly being lazed from beyond visual range. Frustration is a very common, recurring, theme and is used to encourage players to buy premium time and/or vehicles: DO NOT PLAY IF YOU ARE NOT WILLING TO COUGH UP SOME MONEY; YOU WILL NEVER MAKE IT TO THE HIGH TIERS. Air Battles seem to be much more realistic, but are simply un-fun with a battle-ranking system that is designed to incur frustration. This game is HEAVILY monetized, and will push you to buy something at every corner- it's honestly suffocating. -- Synopsis: ground battles rng-based and are not ground battles, air battles suck because of BR, game is shamelessly designed around addicting then frustrating players to buy premium vehicles, premium account is absolutely necessary to make it to top tier.\n",

      "3480/4320 | 76561198349286260 → I used to like this game. After all, this is the most accessible and simple tank/air sim. But the more updates the game gets, the more disappointed I become. I was fine with drones, I could even somewhat bear arty tanks being added to every tier. There's not much room for deveploment for the game and the devs don't seem to want to improve what they have instead. One of the biggest issues I have is the maps. They're just bad, with some of them not having any cover, and some maps literally only got worse after gaijin decided to remake them, (not talking about the graphics remake). On way too many of them you'll find yourself being spawncamped like carpathians, volokolamsk, maginot.. Some are so big that you might spend your whole game on them looking for enemies, without ever seeing any. Another issue that bothers me is the graphics. The game gets prettier with every update, no doubt, but the visuals will very often obstruct your view (like gun smoke when someone shoots), giving players with worse graphics an advantage. The balance in the game and the tiers assigned to tanks become more and more weird to me. How can TO-55 be 8.0? Why were AMX-40 and leo2k moved to 10.0? And these are just the first things that come to my mind. The tech trees are now filled with prototype tanks that never entered proper production. What used to be somewhat historical is not a mix of tanks of different eras and generations. But the latest update brought something way worse than anything I've seen in this game: SLAMRAAM and IRIS-T and the new radar menu that came with them. Now you don't even have to really do anything, just press one button to get your kills. It would've been fine if these missiles could actually be dodged. Just had a sitiuation when I spawned my Tiger HAD and got shot down before I could take off. Considering how long it takes to grind helis this is just ridicolous. You spend hundreds of hours to unlock your heli just to find out people can just press one button and kill you. The game is simply not worth playing in its' current state. It used to better, it used to be something I enjoyed, I used to think it was fun to play, but it somehow just keeps getting worse with every update. The sad thing is that gaijin can keep making such horrible updates, as there is simply no other game like this, no competitor. Just don't waste your time on this and play something else.\n",

      "3554/4320 | nan → A review on War Thunder - more than just War Thunder war - this is not just a game.This is a large -scale military canvas where history, technology and adrenaline converge.The project from Gaijin Entertainment over the years of its existence has turned from simply an interesting aviation simulator into one of the most complex and living military actions available for free.Air, earth, sea-choose where to be a hero want to break through the clouds on the legendary IL-2 or fire from a \"tiger\" in a dense forest?Or maybe you dream of a marine battle, where every torpedo is a chance to win?War Thunder provides such an opportunity.Hundreds of really existing combat vehicles of different eras are represented here - from the Second World War to the Cold War and modernity.Each battle is a story.Sometimes short and bright, sometimes long and tactical.But always saturated.The variety of gameplay arcade battles is fast, spectacular, for everyone.Realistic - for those who want a little more hardcore and fidelity of history.Simulative modes-level \"I turn on the second engine manually and feel like a pilot B-17.\"You can play both on the keyboard with the mouse and on the gamepad, and fans of complete immersion connect joysticks, pedals and VR.The development and graphics of War Thunder is constantly updated.New nations come out, cards are added, graphics are improved.Realistic effects of damage, detailed design models, dynamic weather - visually the game is impressive.🤝 The command work and the community here is not the most accurate, but the one who thinks command.Coordination, knowledge of the card, support of allies is important.And also - the ability to lose and study.The community is actively, the forum is alive, there are many guides and clans.You won’t be lonely.Cons?Of course, there is a Donat at high levels can simplify progress, but does not guarantee victory.The balance is limited at times, especially in mixed battles.A complex entry threshold in realistic modes.But all these are shades of depth, not problems.War Thunder is not a game for the evening.This is a game that is returned to years.Bottom line: 9/10 War Thunder is not just Free-to-Play, but one of the most ambitious military simulators in the world.If you love equipment, strategy and a sense of real war - welcome to battle.\n",

      "3621/4320 | nan → Don't bother wasting your time or money. This game is for people who want call of duty on wheels or wings. Gameplay is entirely brainless, reckless and suicidal rushing team-death-match on maps entirely too small for the vehicles. Of course “team” in the loosest sense of the word; don’t count on much communication, collaboration or cohesiveness. On the ground side, nearly all maps are death funnels that devolve into spawn camping after 5 minutes. As such you can expect players to rush to the enemy spawn to camp and farm kills as tanks materialize out of thin air. Then hop in a plane and do the same thing but from the sky. On the aircraft side expect to bomb bases ad infinitum to grind through the immensely slow frustration style progression mechanics to incentivize buying your way to the meta of the month. Devoid of any real objectives, every match is completely linear with no real strategic incentives. Even worse, many tiers or nations are completely unplayable due to incredibly poor and malicious balancing, or game breaking bugs that appear every update. This game is ostensibly a vehicle combat game with a blend of simulation and arcade features but in reality completely reduced into fps shooter gameplay due to lack of context. The in game vehicles operate in a vacuum. Where are the trucks, jeeps, apcs, infantry threats, bunkers, landmines, artillery, layered air defenses, SEAD, long range radar, ect…? The good: Experience almost any combat vehicle you want. Could almost be a good game. The bad: Gameplay is second to the grind, must pay to progress within a lifetime. Game breaking bugs last for months if not years. Mechanically scanned radars still broken, unreliable, inconsistent, ghosting targets ect.\n",

      "3639/4320 | nan → TLDR: Best game i cannot recomment to play I have over 4000h in AB Air, and 800 in RB Air, as well as some hundreds of hours in Metal Boxes, ive been playing this game since 2014 on and off (before it was on steam), on until 2017 and again during covid (where most of my RB Air hours come from and that are most of the hours shown in my steam playtime).. The Game itself is great, really great especially Air where its core mode lies as it was designed for that during its inception. However the game has 3 major flaws: 1) The Grind (and thus incentiviced greed) is absurd beyond id say \"Original Game Release ww2\" planes and it puts you often into \"stock\" tank syndrom where everybody you fight outperforms you even on fair matchmaking 2) Matchmaking spread is horrible as a mixture of bad balancing and limited player counds. Enjoy fighting IR Homing rockets without countermeassures - i can only assume its similar for Tanks. 3) The Tech Tree forces you to grind out planes you do not want due to its rule \"you need to unlock X ammount of planes per tier to progress\". This is especially annoying in low vehicle count tech trees. Air specific issue: In the old days, there where actual ground battles of AI Tanks and Ships etc ongoing, every plane had its place, even Swordfish Torpedo Bombers. Because if you didnt deal with the ground targets but the enemy does, you start do bleed tickets. Countless games where won not with chasing that last spaceship bomber up at absurd heights but by kamikazeing into the last enemy tank. Or Aircraft carrier.. yes i did the thing and i shouted Banzai and it was fun. Over the years it became a bit \"baserush with 1000kg bombs\" and once they figured that is bad, they changed Air to basically be TDM only. You can kill ground targets or technically bomb the base but nowdays nearly all games are purely about Dogfights, which is fine but then makes like half the planes designed for something not worth anymore. It hurts me to say this but, if you plan to play this game, keep to at max WW2 levels, dont go beyond in air. Ideally play with a friend so you can circumvent the toxicity a bit. Oh also if you see the fancy FA18's and Leopard 2 tanks in the videos, and want to play those, even with whaling have fun grinding for years to get to those. Yes during the OG Play run of this game i unlocked the full Japanese Tree, American Tree 80% German and about 80% Russian tree..\n",

The economy become highly questionable, especially with the \"active\" calculation.

      "3729/4320 | 76561198855805126 → War Thunder has incredible potential — amazing vehicle models, beautiful maps, and the ability to fight on land, in the air, and at sea. Unfortunately, the developers (Gaijin) treat players like cash cows. Instead of working on balance or improving gameplay quality, they keep adding more premium vehicles that can ruin the fun entirely. Examples? Turm 3, 2S38, VIDAR, and many others. This problem might be tolerable if the game wasn’t flooded with pay-to-win elements. Example? Bushes — yes, virtual bushes that you have to buy with real money. You can use them to cover your tank’s weak spots, which is an obvious unfair advantage over players who don’t have them. Then there’s the horrible grind. I have over 3,000 hours in the game and still haven’t reached top tier. I’m part of a tiny group (about 0.01% of players) who use helicopters for so-called rocket runs… which Gaijin also ruined. They changed helicopter damage models in a ridiculous way — a single 7.62 mm bullet can ground a helicopter. On top of that, helicopters cost 3x more spawn points than other vehicles, and their dedicated PvE mode hasn’t been updated in years (with tanks in convoys that can drive along the bottom of lakes!). Matchmaking is another disaster. The game has only 12 BRs and desperately needs decompression. Right now, you can drive a Tiger II H and in the same match face… a PzH 2000. Sounds like a joke, but it’s the reality. The whole game feels like it’s made with the least possible effort, just so “the snail” (Gaijin) can make as much money as possible without doing anything meaningful, all while ignoring the players who actually want this game to be good. In its current state, I do not recommend investing your time or money in War Thunder. Shoutout to everyone who made it to the end.\n",

      "3756/4320 | nan → War Thunder review: Hell disguised as War Thunder military simulator is not a game.It is a trap.A frustration bottomless well, a divine punishment disguised as entertainment, psychological torture for the naive who once thought that \"Gaijin knows what he does.\"From the first moment you install it, you start feeling how your soul escapes slowly while immersing yourself in one of the slower, unbalanced and sartically designed progression systems that the video game industry has given birth.Do you want that modern tank?Prepare for months of infernal grindeo, or better yet: take your card and pay the god Gaijin to let you breathe.Total imbalance Matchmaking is a Russian roulette with bullets in all cameras.Forget about having fair games.Here they send you to die against tanks or airplanes that not only exceed you in technology, but also humiliate you with a single shot, while you need 3 impacts in the same place to scratch them the paint.Criminal monetization The War Thunder's business model is a scam disguised as free-to-play.Do you want to progress decently?Buy a premium account.Do you want decent vehicles without spending 300 hours in the technological tree?Buy a premium vehicle.Do you want to repair your vehicle after a disastrous battle where you were cannon meat?PAY!Literally the game charges you for losing.Controls and Physics: A bad joke Do you like simulators?Well, War Thunder tries to be, but only in what suits him.The controls sometimes respond with the grace of a fridge with wheels, and physics seems designed by a drunk monkey that once read about the severity in Wikipedia.Mechanics change without warning, and what yesterday was a viable strategy today is a guaranteed suicide.Community: Toxic with capital T t prepare yourself for a players base that mixes rancid nationalisms, poorly channeled war obsession and a technical arrogance that would make an engineer cry.If you enter the forum to criticize the game, prepare to be attacked by fans who believe that War Thunder is a doctoral thesis of military history and that you do not deserve to comment if you do not know how many millimeters the inclined armor of a T-34 has.Updates that ruin more than they fix each update brings with it the promise of improvements .. and the delivery of more bugs, more imbalances and more broken premium vehicles.Gaijin seems to have as a motto: \"If you are not broken, you will break it. And if you are already broken, ignore it.\"Final verdict: War Thunder is not a game: it is a psychological resistance test.It is the Dark Souls of frustration, but without learning, without glory, and with a wallet bleeding.The only thing that is improved over time at War Thunder is your tolerance for suffering.Avoid it.Uninstal it.Check it if you can.And if you ever thought this was a serious military simulator ... Congratulations: you just be recruited by the Army of Digital Masochism.I totally recommend it\n",

You will never kill with a shot after Level 2, you will have to give several shots to kill the opponents.4. When you do not die with one shot (rarely), your tank will be immobilized with your operators, and will die with a second shot.5.

      "3810/4320 | 76561198184797602 → The best way to spend your life savings. Never-ending fun, as you bully your platoon mates and try to win against Soviet machines. Never-ending suffering in the form of a Yak-9K with APHE, smashing through your Pzkpfw. VI and knocking out your entire 3rd SS Totenkopf crew. The best feeling you can only experience here at Gajin Snail Farm. Suffering in the form of endless waves of Russian T-34 tanks that will outlast a concrete bunker. You will experience all this and more while playing this relaxing game. You will try to grind battle pass for some cheap machine, only to sell it for €16. Because you have the vision of buying an IS-7 on Gajin market place for a respectable 2000 GJN, that is €2000. It is worth every penny. You will love it when, in your World War II machine, constructed from German steel, you encounter post-war machines whose cannons and ammunition will have no problem with your Third Reich gem. And now seriously. If you are not just a whiny little girl who curses at Russian machines and that everyone around you is a cheater and you learn something about the machines that you will often face, you will be successful in the game. The game itself offers you to educate yourself about the armor of the machines, how to take them out, etc. You have a wide range of nations to choose from, which machines you can play as. Machines that you can try out and it is up to you which you will love, which you will not like and which you will hate. If you stick with WWII machines until Br. 5.0, you will be satisfied. With the Battle Pass you can earn some money on the marketplace, so you will not have to put any money into the game (the exception is buying the Battlepass) and buy premium vehicles for your preferred nation. There is an option to gamble crates in the game to get premium items, premium days, etc. All this for the game currency you earn by playing. I believe you will enjoy this game and I look forward to seeing you on the battlefield.\n",

      "3840/4320 | 76561198320489234 → The game is patented by realism.All heavy tanks on any combat rating are breaking into silhouette.Because a technique that was created after 5-20 years plays against them.The developers were not in the bastard to make a \"modern skating armor\" in which the resistance coefficient is 0.01 above.But in the bastard it was to add German skating armor that crumbled from any hit.The only technique that makes sense in this game is cars with large guns.Usually, a machine from the end of 45 years gets against tank 41. cartridges are not hung about it, and it pierces everything in the world in the silhouette.It is impossible to play in the fleet, there are no people there.Simulative battles that would correct the situation (from the technique of 39 against the technology of 44 years) are available only if you are lucky.You can only take equipment from the list and it changes once at a time.Do you want to frolic on old wedges?Saw the snail today can only be played on technology from the end of World War II.Do you want to rob on the techniques of the end of the Second World War?Saw today, on the contrary, only the tancules from Seridina and the beginning of the war.I am a rivet and a whiner.It would seem just go to simulator battles and you will not meet the Swedish self-propelled guns of the 60s-70s (on the tank 41 years).But in order to play simulator battles, it is advisable to pump all the equipment in the game and buy all the premised tanks, and then prays so that the right era falls out.And even the realism with which the panted the game does not spread out on kumuli and landmines.The landmine that essentially delivers the explosion inside the tank, now only pisses a cumulative stream.Fogas can burst about the tank tower and the crew will not even stun.Not to mention various kinds of explosive waves that could kill the crew without damaging the armor.The game promises realistic technology and \"Batalia where tanks, planes and even a fleet participate at the same time.\"That by the way lies of pure water, the fleet does not participate in battles with another equipment.There is no regime where all 3 types of equipment would participate.And of course, only luck will suck will get up of the IS3 against the tiger or against the blush from the present.It is absolutely incomprehensible why a heavy tank, medium tank, light tank, anti -aircraft gun and PT SAU are different.If the combat rating is made so that all types of this equipment are on the plain.Example: there is such a heavy KV1 tank, it is 39 years of release.There is a German tank PZ 4 F1, PZ 4 F2.PZ F1 is short -barreled and pierces a KV with great difficulty or does not break through at all.PZ 4 2 years older than kV and pierces it with an average frequency.The game puts a KV on 1 rating with PZ 4 F2.It turns out that KV1 pierces PZ 4 F2 with varying success, and PZ 4 F2 breaks through KV1 with varying success.Only KV 1 is more expensive in a call on the battlefield.It does not sound very logical for me, but that's not all.The game puts shielded PZ 4 F2 modifications on the same rating as KV1.According to the screens of the modification of 44 years, more shells appeared that can break through the equipment more efficiently.PZ 4 F2 44 years pierces KV1 literally in the silhouette, he does not break through with KV1, stands less on the battlefield on the battlefield.And is placed in the game 1 rating with KV1.If the screens and a slightly more penetrating gun are so little appreciated by the game, it means that the screen KV1 will be +- on the same rating?There is no shielded kV1 with a gun abruptly on the same ranking with tigers and panthers.As a result, it turns out unfair for the riveter (a person who will hold on every rivet rivet in terms of historicism like me) the situation.The technique that was very good for its time, meets with a technique that was disgusting for its time.And the eyes shows that even the worst ATGM or gun of the 60s, it will easily break through the armor of the tank 50x.As a result, the heavy tanks that were a Wundervafe pierce everything into the silhouette, cars without armor with a 100mm gun ride along the edge of the map and hide in the bushes.All all the equipment is breaking through all the equipment costs 70-90 balls and the other 120-130.\n",

First off tech tree is a jumbled mess, after a destroyer you might get a light tank or even a SPAA and none of the guide lines even matter since you can just research the tree as you please. Besides that the time requirement to research anything is way greater than in its competitors. The combat itself somehow manages to feel more random than in world of tanks, if you shoot when the cross is green you might or might not penetrate because the tanks are very specifically laid out according to their real world counterparts. While this does sound cool on paper in practice unless you know each and every tank internally you will feel like you rolled a natural 1 with +20 to hit and still missed. Maps are quite horrendeous compared to world of tanks as well, while in WOT you got more from less in War Thunder you got a lot of maps that just feel like ''What IF'' question without any additional thought.

After more than 400 hours, I allow myself to be able to form an opinion about it.First, the game is 60-75% on happiness, the remaining around 25-40% are on skill and based on skills, on some days you make 8-10 kills in realistic armored battles and die 2-3 times and win, but you don't die kill on other days but also 3-5 times and loses.Well, you just had bad luck, but not when something like that as a bad or lucky strand continues for several days and the frustration limit has long been exceeded.The matchmaking is very in need of improvement and the BR system is also very questionable, obviously many aircraft and tanks have an either too high or too low BR What leads to that some vehicles either dominate the slaughter or are literally led to the slaughterhouse.On the other hand, \"CAS\" is abbreviated to Close Air Support in realistic tank battles not only very annoying but also frustrating, not only that they are now dominating the tanks, but they are also responsible for the fact that many open combat vehicles can no longer be played without one or more tantrum.Nashorn, 8.8 cm Flak 37 SFL, Breda 90/53, ZIS-30 .. Also the sheer number of winged suicide that are waiting at the spawn point only so not only to be able to get a second player to death, also not really contributes to a harmonious gaming experience.For me, grinding is strongly borderline (the developers have to make money somehow) The cards are itself .. well .. for the most part in order with some negative and positive outliers.Also problematic is the frustration limit that is often exceeded, probably also wanted by the developers so that more players reinvesting real money into the game: I would not recommend it, except those who still weigh between World of Tanks and was Thunder, although it has many quirks, it is always better than the competitor from Wargaming.Meddl of my Kaschba!\n",

      "4148/4320 | 76561198064247148 → ultimately, I can't recommend this, despite it being occasionally fun. queueing for matches takes a long time, and the grind is really long to get even tier 2 vehicles, unless you make playing this game your day job.it can still be fun to play around with the starting vehicles of each nation. but after 100 hours, you're still probably going to be playing around with those starting vehicles, mostly, unless you commit to one nation, one type of battles (air land or, sea, I guess. sea battles.. exist) you won't make much progress unlocking vehicles. If you aren't playing games at least rank 2 or higher, you're actually not eligible to participate in events, which kinda sucks if you're still stuck in the early stages of every tech tree. and unfortunately there's not really any single player content worth playing, in case you get sick of the multiplayer aspect. All in all it's a game that demands a dtaggering amount of your time( and your money, if you're inclined to swipe instead of grind) and offers, in my opinion, not enough in return for that investment. Well, the one sgood thing about this game is the same as it's greatest weakness: that it can really burn through hours. if you've got time to kill, this game will kill it; it all depends on if you're looking or a game that you can sink countless days into, or if you get annoyed when a game is slow.\n",

A middle-aged man came up to me and asked a “bag needed?”.Being still in a state of shock, he nodded mechanically.I was given a coleophane package with the inscription of the TURMS, and a Bank of Baltika-9 beer appeared in my left hand.Passing by people sharply began to laugh at me and poke their fingers.Why are they doing this?I still did not understand what was the matter, but I knew for sure that I needed to get out of here.Throwing to the exit and pushing all the passers -by, I opened the door and went out into some destroyed brick barn.“Fuh, I got out,” I thought before hearing a strange rumble above my head.The last thing I saw was the figure of a huge aircraft with a portrait of Stalin.A strange barrel fell towards the barn, the anthem of the USSR came from it.My days are numbered.\n",

      "4191/4320 | 76561198980600128 → I am fully aware this might be a skill issue, but I feel the game fails to teach mechanics and tips to me, that I have to fully look for on my own online in order to have a chance to play the game. I have never felt so powerless in a game, where I try everything, focus on good positioning, make sure I am with my team, and aim towards enemies with the indicator showing a green crosshair; indicating a good shot, just for the shot to not penetrate. I can understand I am technically at fault in these interactions, but I see no way to improve. Every death just just end with me seeing a shot penetrating my highest armored section, from a vehicle 0.5 to 1.0 battle ratings higher than me, that shot me from the most absurd angle. I try my best every game, but fighting old guard after old guard just makes me feel disappointed with myself more than anything. I want to like this game, I enjoy the concepts, but the sheer wall to entry is too much, and way too little effort is done to help ease it. I can understand that players should be rewarded by their understanding of the game, and their skills -- by winning interactions, but man does it feel bad at the receiving end. Is there no players that are at my skill range that I can fight against? Is there not enough people in the 37,000 concurrent players who are at my skill level to fill a lobby? Must I sink or swim my way to learning the game? I feel powerless, and I feel impactless (<--not a word, I know, shut up) every game; regardless of victory or defeat. TLDR: I am bad at video games\n",

Negative progress should NOT be achievable in a game like this. even after the amount of time ive put into this game, i havent hit rank 8 in ANY country (mostly because i like playing every way available) and having to spent weeks, if not months, to unlock ONE, SINGLE vehicle is a waste of my time.

      "4280/4320 | 76561199867606770 → Here's my review of my short time on this game. 1. Only the 3 big nations ( America, Russia and Germany ) are viable. Gaijin ( the game devs ) dont really care about minor nations like France or Britain. So if you want to start with those you won't love it as much as the big 3. 2. Far from reality, they do base the game on a level of realism but when the reality isn't what they want they change it in the name of ``balance``. They have a huge bias for some nations, if they would have the option to buff Germany or Britain you bet they choose Germany to appeal the majority even if it should be the opposite to face reality. Alot of Britain's main positives have been nerfd over the years to appeal the big 3 nations. 3. Vehicles are in the wrong tech trees to get more money. Instead of putting a CANADIAN vehicle in the obvious nation BRITAIN, they put them in other nation like GERMANY and AMERICA because they get more player thus more money opportunities. To wrap it up, if you want to play the big nations you will enjoy it, some vehicles you really want are locked behind a paywall and the company is VERY capitalist if you catch the drift. Though it'S free to try out so, all you lose is time and sanity.\n",
